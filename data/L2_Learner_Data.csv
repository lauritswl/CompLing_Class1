048_CNUK1115.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In china, the PLA was consisted of only professional soldiers. But in many other countries, military service is compulsory and every citizen will have to proform as a soldier for several years. especially young university students. And in my opinion. military service should be compulsory .
There are several reasons why I think so. First, China, as the largest country of East Asia, had the widest borderline. To keep the whole borderline safe is not an easy thing. It need a large military force to be on duty all the time. But the soldiers sent to a certain place may not be familiar with the environment. Even they are professional soldiers, they may probably meet some troubles. If military service was compulsory, the border line can then be guarded by soldiers selected from local people who were familiar with local environment. And they can certainly do the job better than soliers from other places . .
Second, nowadays' young man are lack of life experience. They often care little about others and lack of discipline. Some of them even had never had any hardship and always waste things. Although Chinese government forced every university student to have a month's military training, it had little effect. People can't be changed in only a month. Comparing to these young man. those who had joined the army and serviced as professional soldiers are much more disciplinal and energetic .
So just imagine that if all the youngsters will have to serve in the military for several years, will it still be so many problems about youngster? 
Third, although the world is peace now, it still has the possibility of breaking out a war. And after so many years of disarmament, china's present military forces may not be enough for a war. But if military service was compulsory, those people who bad had military training can form a great military force at any time. That means almost every citizen can be the part of resistance to the invasion. Such things had happened once during the Second World War, when the Japanese army invaded China. At that time, almost everyone: soldiers, guerrillas and even citizens fought against the Japanese invader. And everyone may know that we won the war and defeated Japanese invader successfully .
Forth, armies formed by professional soldiers often developed slowly. Because every soldier had the same training and this made them always thought and acted in the same way. For this ""the army had few good commanders and new tactics. This will cause the army losing the ability of fighting. Now the PLA was starting a 
revolution, ""trying to avoid such situation. In fact, I think the best and easiest solution is to let military service be compulsory .
Although letting military service be compulsory has so many advantages, it also has disadvantages comparing to forming the army consist of professional soldiers .
For example: more money is needed to train soldiers, and soldiers may not as good as professional ones. But after all, make military service be compulsory can do good to not only the army ""but the education as well. That's why I choose it .","Forth, armies formed by professional soldiers often developed slowly.",B1
227_ITRS1001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"If someone should define the twentieth century in one word he would call it the television era. Nowadays we are so used to television that we find difficult to think that it did not exist before, and that our ancestor did not even know what it was .
So we may happen to find ourselves asking: what did they do then? How did they pass their time? The matter is that we cannot think of our life without television if we think accurately of a sample of our day we find out that we watch television throughout the day .
Generally speaking one person watches television at least three times during the day. The first one is in the morning: as soon as he wakes up he switches television on to hear news and then of course during the meals which means at lunch time and dinner .
Seldom, as soon as he goes back home in the late afternoon, after a long working day, he switches television on maybe because he feels relaxed by watching at it, or maybe just because he is annoyed and he thinks that television could help him .
If we count the hours that we pass in front of television we notice that we spend at least the third part of our day watching it .
Now, the problem is not the fact that we watch at it. As a matter of fact, television is useful because we can recent news every hour and we can know what happens in the other hemisphere of the world in real time .
Further more, some programs are very interesting and useful. Let's think about health programs which teach us how to discover or to cure an important disease. Or let's just think of the didactic or somehow entertaining documentaries: those about history .
It is out of doubt that thanks to television we can learn new things and come in touch with different realities that otherwise we cannot know or which at least it would be very difficult for us to know .
The real problem is that several times, if not always, we cannot do with out television. May people cannot bear not even one day of their lives without watching at it. Sometimes they also give up to interesting situations like for instance going out with friends or have a chat with them, because they prefer to stay home watching at their favourite program. Moreover, if someone talks to them while they are immerged in a program they don't even answer back .
In a certain way for this kind of people, television becomes a sort of drug. Their relationship with television is of dependence and they become incapable of conducting their life detached from this domestic * tool *.
In this content I totally agree with the fact that if Marx was alive he would state that television is the opium of the masses. But of course, is not only in this sense that we must consider the phrase. For many reasons, television, with its programs distracts people's attention from real problems. Its forms of entertainment which in some way are rather foolish, banal and far from being cultural aim to detach people from reality. As a result people are led to ignore political and social problems .
Watching television is a passive action because you receive images, news and words but you do not really create anything. Sometimes it forbids you to think, especially to think in a critically way. In certain way television does not allow you to develop your personality or at least a personality which is a different from that of others .
It seems infact that one of the television goals is that of bringing people all to the same level especially the one of language. Even if we do not realise it, we tend to speak all in the same way using the same words which are those that we hear from television programs .
Marx would certainly transform his statement replacing religion with television: but what I think is that he should also invite people to make a good use of it, because if we understand the real value of it I am sure that people's life will certainly improve .","The real problem is that several times, if not always, we cannot do with out television.",B1
486_TSNO1308.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Society should not punish the criminals but try to motivate them or to bring them to their normal lives. No one is allowed to be punished, but to advised about what she/he was doing. This can be solved by inviting psychologists to give them free lessons about their behavior and also the society should be invited to tell them about how they behave in their community. As an individual, you can avoid yourself in many things for an example to be a criminal, youth group and sports should be formed .
Is a responsibility of the society to motivate the criminals, not to bring them to prison because they are human beings just like anybody. They have their needs in life, they are normal. The society should councel them about how are they doing to be in future. This, can affect them in their mentality. They can be given life sentence if they don't behave well for example if the society tell you about the advantages and disavantages of what you have being all along then you don't take them into consideration, is then that you are judged for a life sentence .
The psychologist should also invited to councel them about what is going to happen in future .
If you are a criminal, there are some forces that forced you do that, for example if you see a beautiful car, you will steal it for the purpose of money, simply means you are under pressure. They are various ways of getting money not to put yourself in danger. You can go to school and become educated and finally you can get a job .
Youth groups should be build by the society so that many people could take part. There must be some dramas or music so that they can keep theirselves busy. The aim of this youth groups is to avoid people to misbehave .
Also the society should build sports. The sports offices should be there to help people in sport activities e.g. soccer, netball, tennis, high jump etc. People should take part on this activities to keep themself healthy and strongly, because their muscle are working every day .
As a person or an individual, you have to avoid yourself in doing wrong thing.

Because I still do not master English skill. It's not teachers fault. I didn't think strongly that I want to speak English in the future. So I think that their feelings help their study if students have motivation to English. Second, I think that most important thing is teaching English enjoyably. I think that students will become don't like English if teacher is so strict. And student will be bored by she or he teach in accordance with only textbook or examination. So I want that students will have interest in English. Then I prepare some materials for keeping student's concentration. For instance, the case of word test, teachers change usual test on paper to word bingo or games. Third, I think that English education of junior senior high school in Japan that take a leading part of grammar. Some of schools, which studying English for examination. Although grammar is important, I think that studying grammar is not perfect right way to be able to speak English. So after I teach one grammar point, students make sentence to use new grammar. I want to teach useful English in the future. For example, student will get opportunity of speak in the class or speak new grammar sentence. Therefore I need to create an atmosphere that students can open their mouth in the class. I think that students will have confidence to speak English if they keep on speaking since they are first year. Finally, I think that student should have listening ability. Because I can't communicate if I don't understand what the other person said even I can say my opinions or feelings. I thought that English is difficult when I was junior high school student. I think that I was afraid of English because I didn't get used to listening English. So students need to listen English because of they get rid of their feeling like mine. Therefore I think that teacher should have better teach to use Oral Approach. Teacher can use both of Japanese and English in that way .
I think that teachers have energy to teach for students. I heard that teachers often use negative word in the class. I think it is one of fact that students don't like or willing to study English. I think that it is fault of teachers to students can not understand. So I will not want to say that why do you understand. I want to be a teacher who has respect for each student and never gives up for teach. I want to teach English accurately, so that I should learn about English and other knowledge.",So teacher should not teach by only textbook .,B1
177_GRAR3002.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"During the last decades tremendous changes have occur in a woman's life and roles in a society. The feminist movement has contributed largely to that and as every big and important current as this, it has brought many diversities of opinions and argues and debates. Many are the supporters who strongly agree to it but many are the ones who oppose and report that feminism is the cause for the ""corruption"" of a woman .
	But lets see the matter from a closer point of view. Due to feminism, woman has power. She is an important and respectable tool to a society, who contributes for the generous improvement in it. A woman since late 70's has gained the freedom of speech and will. She is independent and can participate, take action in al the sections of life. Horizons in job, house, family, sexual relationships and state affairs have expanded. In the society of the 20th century we see woman in very high and strong positions, head principles, general manager, scientists, musicians and even presidents, as lady Thatcher in Britain years ago .
	Also, women's role in a house and family has taken another form. She is not anymore the one responsible for house labour and raising the children but these roles have become etc. hangeable with the other sex and less demanding so as for a woman to fill her personality with other interests .
	Thirdly, sexual relationships are more loose and gives the woman the opportunity to meet a lot of individuals, live or marry many times (of course the number of legitimate marriages varries from country to country) and discover with whom she can be satisfied and happy. This is very important since in the old days women had fixed weddings and were forced to spend their life with a person they hardly knew .
	As we see, feminism, has brought dramatic changes in a woman's role which have led to an improvement of life standards. But let me mention at this point the bad effects of this social movement. The strong devotion to job necessities causes less valuable time to build a personal life. Carreerists spend many years in job qualification and either end up bachelors or with a miserable family. Children grow up with the lack of motheressee care and husbands feel at their bones the ellipsis of their wife. This is an important reason why many couples divorce in our days .
	Also, since women have become very active in a society's marketing consumption an immense part of products is addressed to her, having as a result the brainwashing of her needs and an incline to materialism. As a result, we witness many women today to talk only about how they must go to a gym, buy all kinds of hydrating cremes and cosmetics and not to mention the tendency or better passion for buying clothes. Overall when the main core of feminism is sidetracked it, we end up with the diversion of the essential goals' which is freedom and independence .
	A feminist movement was very much needed when it was forced upon the countries. But since then, the societies have changed, and the issue is not if feminism has done more harm or more good but to employ feminism according the basis, structure of each society, in order for women not to loose their real personality. For example, feminism as it is expressed in Western countries cannot be applied upon Eastern ones who remain far behind modern civilization. A mousoulman woman who has learned all her life to dress in long dresses and hide their faces with big scarfs cannot be forced to wear minies and dye her hair. She needs a legitimate system who will prevend misbehave from her husband, as it is accustomed to many countries, like Iran, Iraque and not one who will let her buy modern clothes and cosmetics. Feminism is an active movement who needs to be modified throughout the years in order to be applied to societies having as a basis the real, actual needs of a woman.",The strong devotion to job necessities causes less valuable time to build a personal life.,B1
210_IRKI09041.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"When students first register in university, they begin a new section of their life, they should know they will encounter a completely new style of learning and acquiring lessons. The students, who have a perfect background in their new field of study, must have been more successful than other students. I completely disagree with the topic, because education is never null. I think it depends on the students view of how they think about the value of university, they interest in their field, they knowledge about chances in university, and their effort to achieve their goals.
	First thing is how a student thinks about university? Does university degree won't be theoretical and useless for his life world and his future life. He can also apply what he had learned, in his conduct and social skill. Although some people think there is no value in studying in university, but the fact is another thing and it would completely change a man's behavior, lifestyle, and point of view . 
Interest is another factor which helps students to be as successful as possible in their future. If a student is interested in his field of study he could be able to do his best and be prepared for the real world and utilizes what he had learned, in his vocation, by going to university and acquiring new subjects he could know better what he can do by what he got form education.
In addition to value of university and interests of students, as we know university stands a chance of doing something. Little knowledge in a major which a student sees a lifelong ambition in it and a daunting challenge will guarantee success. Nowadays, people do not pay respect to degree. They'll look at his remarkable achievements on what he is sure to do it, i means his proficiency, something that he has been skilled in. University, is a place where students rise above problems in their lessons, investigations, (etc.). There is a strong chance of learning new methods. It is a place where he can develop right personal qualities, learn misleading information and further more try hardly to compile them. Lack of knowledge is never admirable but, knowledge is not enough to make money. University will give him the chance and motivation. It's his duty to work out depend on the major, knowledge he could also studies different books and resources during his university period to learn and urgent and unexpected problems and do his best to tackle it and end in failure in a real life style. He is hardly likely to strengthen motivation in work if pursue only theoretical information, he has to put forward a plan to get worked up about his knowledge and something he is going to do equally. He has a head for figures which can make his personality, nut it depends on his sight of view in university, he can have a noticeable effect on his degree. In addition everyone has a mind of one's own whether get ready for a future job and lifestyle by learning lessons, different books and working out, or studying only for a piece of paper, called degree. But realize an ambition in different aspects of life or have an outstanding achievement in other profession.
	Finally it may far-fetched for some people to achieve their goals and expectations in university. But it won't be possible for a student to achieve his expectations unless he try as much as he can for making his goals accessible and study in advance levels of his favorite major.
In conclusion, we can say that it's the matter of students thought about every aspects of university degree. Whether they think it is valuable or not, they can gain more profession in what they are interested in or not, and if they attempt an effort help them to achieve their goals or not. Hopefully, I think university degree is not theoretical and prepares students for the real world. Naturally there are lots of differences between educated person's lifestyle and non-educated one. In university we would learn something beyond what we have learned before in other steps of our life.","In addition to value of university and interests of students, as we know university stands a chance of doing something.",B1

Certainly, It is emphasized by a lot of people, but actually even if almost all the Japanese people study English, they can not speak English fluently or can not understandEnglish. If we overcome this serious problem, we can get native speaker's thought. In other words, this is the first step to get ability of language. Now there are three ways to make full use of practicing .
 First, we should watch TV programs (e.g. CNN, BBC, ABC, TV of present day and so on). We can hear the latest words most easily in the TV programs, because it reflects the trend in society. While we watch the TV programs, you should try to write down popular expressions, and you could learn to make proper use of honorific expressions, the language of young people or daily language usage. There are other ways of doing this exercise. At first, it is reading newspaper (for New York Times and Los angels Times and so forth.) This is not for listening practice but for reading it. At the same time, we can learn the latest languages from sentences. Next, it is using Internet. We can get more recent informations from languages, and it fed information into a computer. What's more the computer is capable of storing millions of pieces of it, so whenever we want to know it, we can pull it out. It is your continual efforts that lead you to success. That is why we need to be careful about our home environment. That is to say, Japanese has a register, so does English. They tend to overlook this point, but it is an important field to make out people of different countries .
Second, we should make use of e-mail more and more, and you are able to make friends over the entire world. If you make a friend in different countries, you can exchange opinions with them. For example, common habits and their school life within the same generations and so on. Whether you want to make e-mail friends, you had better connected the site of making friends. This will lead us difference of how to use register between English and Japanese . ""Phatic communion"" and ""small talk"" are clearly different things within the same generations. It is important that we learn the way of speaking from our heart .
The last point is that we had better study implication of languages, because we can find out different styles of each country. It is difficult to understand this, and maybe it is the largest subject what we learn other countries thorough English .
We often tend to overlook these ideas, but this is essential for international society, and it is an important part in relationships. That is to say we have to study the latest words, and we should understand different countries, cultures and temperament. The truth is that, we are surrounded by a lot of opportunity of learning English, but we missed them, so we must be careful watch them .",Now there are three ways to make full use of practicing .,B1

Some people might say university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Well, in my point of view, people who said that might not be educated in university in their life. I admit that preparation for entering the real world is not enough for students in universities. But think about that, why those people with university degrees are easier to get a job? Doing degrees in university has both advantages and disadvantages .
The advantage of doing a degree in university is obvious. Why those companies want graduator of university? Because those people already have been educated in a high standard although in a very theoretical way. But theoretical does not necessary mean useless, instead, it is the experience of those people learned before, which can help university students preventing making the same mistake. Theoretical knowledge is totally not a bad thing. Let us compare to what happens in the real life, think about our driving lessons. I believe that pupils read awful a lot about how to drive before putting their hands on the steering wheel. Just like university degrees, they must pass the paper work like theory test then take a road test. People said that students get too much theoretical knowledge than practise. I do not think it is the weakness part of university education. Studying theory knowledge is the best way to prepare the coming challenge in the real life. The preparation to entering the real world is not just study theory test as well. As we are all university students, we know there is huge amount of research or business enterprise and all sorts of activity in the university campus. Within university you can meet lot of different people as well, just like the real world, people are coming from all over the country or even from different nations. What a chance to study different things! In the real world, we probably do not have those sorts of chance. So in my point of view, I think university is the best place to do preparation to entering the real world .
Of course, doing theory studying without doing practise is useless. In some university, it does happen which means when students enter into the society, it might cost them more time than others to be fit where they will be .
Anyway, I am a university student right now. I benefit from being a university student a lot and will be in my whole life .

058_CNUK4011.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Feminists, belonging to the most arguable issues in nowadays, play a core
role of job - dividing and social status' forming. Those who support the
equality of male and female believe that feminists are good for women,
while others insist that what feminists have done to women is definitely
more harmful. The argument has been continued for several decades. Along
with the researches of the scientists, new evidences are revealed to give
the latter one stronger proves. Following are the details of this issue .
To begin with, feminists do have given female more chances to prove their
capabilities and creativities. In many working circumstances, women are
playing more important roles than men, or at least equal to men. However,
scientists claimed that there have been too much more working stresses
put on women resulting in the unharmonious between family members and
home violence. According to Jerry Z Muller (2003), nearly 30 percent
women are facing home violence or quarrels with family members result 
from too strong working pressure, which all come from the ideas of
feminists. Dr. Muller said that women are the most significant elements
of a specify family, whose hormone are secreted to keep everything they
may concern into a certain balance, to reduce potential quarrels. The
more attentions women pay to their job, the less they spend to their
family members. What the feminists done is already harmful to women in the
passed decades .
More over, another important difference between men and women is the
strength differences. Women's abilities of heavy work are less than
men's. This phenomenon results from the different amount of water
contained in blood of men and women, the latter contains more than about
15 percent as well as that of men, reducing the oxygen delivering
capability of female. So, it is not strange that men are more suitable to
carry heavy things. Hence, it is too arbitrary to carry out feminists
without concerning the differences between male and female, even though
men and women belong to the same species .
In addition, it is obviously that women are easier to feel tied than men .
It is proved by Mr. Muller that there are more red cells in men's blood
(about 20 percent higher) than that of women's. Since red cells' duty is
to supply the oxygen to the body cells, less red cell inducing women are
easy to get tire in general times. Appropriate concerns about the
different situations between men and women are good to improve the
efficiency of the latter's .
To sum up, though men and women are both human being, they are still quite
different from each other, not only as individuals, but also as two
different genders, which lead to the unlikely job adaptations and family
maintenances. What feminists did in the passed several decades is
definitely too arbitrary to reduce the inappropriate situations that the 
majority of female were facing. Although everything has both sides, the
pros and corns, which is just like a coin gets two sides, each one-sided
view is not justified enough, what feminists have done to female is still
more harmful in the course of women than good .","Muller that there are more red cells in men's blood

As time passed, with the developing of societies and with the increase of needs, that is, when the living conditions have got harder, money's become the root of all evils. At this position, it has gained importance how money is earned and for which purposes it is used. If a person gives harm not only to himself but also to the others and neglect social and ethic rules, it means that he earns money in wrong ways. When we think like this, money has become the reason of several evils. This is because of that money is a magical key which opens many doors. This is also because of the conditions of today. In today's conditions, they aren't nearly given any right to live like human-beings to the poor. However, people living in a society have the same basic rights such as to be educated, to be cared by hospitals and like these, money spoiled this equality and cause inequality. That is, in every stage of social life, the one who pays the piper calls the tune. People give bribe in order to be the owner of many things and to conceal their offense. If there's a need to give an example, a person who commits a traffic crime and gives bribe to conceal his crime will be a good example. This is only a small example. This kind of impropriety has taken place even in the government, which should be the most respectful institution. At the same time, people are murdering each other, they are smuggling narcotic and weapon. This means the complete ignorance of social and ethic rules. In other words, money has taken the place of humanistic values. For the sake of money, people sell their bodies, children and wives. Moreover, in order to survive, they sell their organs, such their kidneys, which has a vital role for their survival. These are organized by groups which are named as Mafia. In other words, this has become a sector .
When people aren't able to achieve the necessary conditions to survive as human beings, that is, when they aren't able to bring bread to their homes, when they can't shelter in appropriate conditions, when they couldn't send their children to the school, when they couldn't respond to his family's needs of health and when they couldn't respond to other needs of their family and most important, when they haven't got a job to achieve all these kind of needs, in societies people can be dragged to suicide. People even commit theft. I want to state that the sanction of social rules isn't important when people find themselves in these conditions .
Because of that money is an important commerce tool, it is an important element of our lives. In other words, in today's hard conditions, people venture everything in order to earn money and survive. They can easily make concession .
As I stated before, it is important how money is earned and for which purposes it is used. So, it will hinder people to suffer if it isn't used in the way of its purpose .","As I stated before, it is important how money is earned and for which purposes it is used.",B1

People give importance money than the other things . They are filled with desire and ambitious , and they become like doing everything to gain the money .
Money is the root of all evils. We will examine this under different categories. There are some people who have to do harm, for they are in a bad condition . They are indeed not bad people but as life is very difficult , it drags them into a bad situation . They do crime in order to survive. On the other hand , there are some who want more and more although they have . They are full of badness. In spite of everyting , they do not become satisfied. They can think of nothing else except money, they like it very much. It becomes their friend, in another word, it is everything for them. Money is like a breathe for them. They are excessively fond of money. There is a proverb about this situation; there is something about money that
is very alluring .
Variety of crimes like murders, robbery, theft, bribery, gambling, smuggling and prostitution are the result of money. People do these crimes to gain the money and become rich in a short time. We see and hear a lot of things on TV every time that many people kill even their relatives and friends to take their money .
I think that money causes not only crimes but also the destruction of the relationship between people. It can cause friends to lose their friendship . Nowadays, since money takes place everything , they do not care about values like friendship. If you have money , you have many many friends, you are the boss and you are the most important and valuable person in the world. For your money , they serve you with utter faithfulness and obedience; on the other hand, they can sell you even your friends .
Unemployment is the most important reason that people may do a crime. Because it drags them into a depression. As a result, they commit a suicide to go on living. Last week, while I was watching news on TV, I saw a man who was arrested because of robbery . His excuse was known; he lost his job owing to economic crises, so he had to do this. He took the responsibility for his wife and three children .
We can give Argentina as an example , too. As we know, Argentina had an economic crises last year. The most important result of economic crises in Argentina was the social deststruction. There were many crimes like plundering . People attacked to the shops and plundered the things. Furthermore , for years , money have caused the countries to lose their relationship. That one country thinks of what will benefit itself and wants to enlarge their land, causes wars, 
I will give an another example about theft. I read a news on newspaper that two men who wanted to take the bag of a pregnant woman attacked her. Also , the sister of the woman who tried to help her was attacked. The woman was taken to the hospital, because she was seriously injured. She was about to die and had to stay at the hospital for days. As her life was in danger , doctors did not let her give a birth . Otherwise, she would lose her life. I do not understand these people , how they can attack a person to take her money .
As we see , all of the bad things are the result of money. It has become our most important need like water and food. People speak most of the time about it, because everything depends on money. The one who pays the piper calls the tune. However, we do not know how to use. As we give importance money than the other things , everything becomes unbalanced. If we can balance everything and use the money properly , there will be no badness in the world .","Variety of crimes like murders, robbery, theft, bribery, gambling, smuggling and prostitution are the result of money.",B1
252_JPSW3008.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"This time I want to think about teaching English. When I was high school student, I liked to study English, but I didn't like English class because how to teach English by teacher did not interest me. Therefore, I was bored and sometimes slept in English class. Now, from my experiences as student I want to give three ideas of teaching English .
First, teacher should be communicating with students well. It is not good that teacher just speak one-side because to just listen to teachers talking is too boring, and students will not be interested in English classes. In actual, they translate English into Japanese themselves, so student's English skills will not be better. Also it is good for students to tell their opinions and feelings because their English skills will improve well for doing so. To present their opinions and talk with teacher will make an impression for students, so students will not forget easy. Moreover, if what students say in English can tell the other students and teacher, they can feel that English is fun and it interests them. For these reasons, I think that communication between teacher and students is very important .
Second, I think that it is good to see and hear natural English. I think that Assistant English teachers who are English native speakers are good for students because students can learn a lot of how to talk from not only textbook also daily conversation with native speaker. Then, native speaker's pronunciation and attitude are different from Japanese, so they act as encouragement to students. For that reason, teacher had better give a lot of chances for students to talk with native speaker. Also, Japanese teacher had better speak English fluently because students imitate teacher's pronunciations. If teacher's pronunciation is not good, student cannot improve their pronunciation of English well, like this I think that teacher should speak natural English. For these reasons, to experience native or natural English is good for students .
Third, all of students should always join classes. I think that students had better feel a little tension in their classes because if they do not feel tension, they don't think well themselves. It is best that teacher make an atmosphere both friendly and tense. Though it is hard that there is a mood of nervous, students will step up their English skills for being call on them. If they don't answer correct, they can learn from mistaking. For that reason, teacher had better put some pressure on their students. Moreover, to pronounce all of students together is good because students will learn for pronouncing again and again, and they can understand well. For these purposes, teacher should have students joining classes well . 	My ideas of teaching English are to communicate with students, to be experienced natural English for students, and to be joined class for students. If teacher do these things, I think students can learn and understand English better.","For that reason, teacher had better put some pressure on their students.",B1

It starts for women who was restrained from the central force such as men and get rid of women species just pursuit equal human beings. but many events undergo and it's meaning varies gradually. Then it degenerate and bring side effects and confusion. So what are the reasons of feminism distort?
 Because first of all, Feminism misguides that women are fragile and inferior beings unconsciously. But the role of mother and wife is very important in society too. They form a family which is the foundation of society. However, in modern society, many people think that the housewife means the women who has nothing to do and the working mom means who has a capability. So women have obsession of perfect women. That cause depression and undergo hard married life extremely .
 Second, it fall from original purpose. Originally they want to get rid of women species and insist equality between men and women. It ignoreS the difference intrinsic attribute between men and women such as their culture or sexual trait. For example, men have a military duty in korea. But Israel women who are over eighteen has a military duty for two years because of religious faith. It looks equal. But in reality, women attribute little about military power because they are weaker than men by nature. In addition, according to some investigation, a quarter of women soldiers pregnant the period of service. So it really hard to mom and baby. Therefore military duty for women is unreasonable by any measure. it doesn't consider about different characteristic between men and women .
 Third, Feminism pursuit the result of equality superficially. It insists chance of equality between men and women originally. But it is distorted and makes distorted stereotyped image of women. So, it makes image of super women who has versatile person. for that reason, many modern women suffer from obsession of super mom image who are capable employee and good mother. So they have to take charge of the raising children and household problem. men works too. But they don't take charge of any other household. It starts from distorted feminism. and it follow the patriarchy that feminism exclude. It has a contradiction . 
 Third, someone misuse Feminism. For example, there is a menstrual leave. It's for women because their physiological trait. but it has a trouble with proof. someone misuse it. Hence, it rise reverse discrimination. Because men have to work more for woman who take menstrual leave. And other women are suspected of abuse. Hence, from the point of view of company, they prefer men to women. finally. Because the boss have to pay their women employee so employing men who don't have menstrual leave is more benefit. Finally, men and other women become victims . 
 But I think that women has a only inherent character like sight of delicacy or attitude of soft. So, we find and recognize those trait and develop them. Above all, meaning of Feminism have to rearrange. Not just for distorted women's rights but for equal human beings. Feminism have to go a appropriate purpose for respect of individual human beings .",Then it degenerate and bring side effects and confusion.,B1

Money determines social position in society. High class is represented mostly by businessmen or employees of American firms. American firms offer to their employees high wages but they must submit everything to their job. Their families and children have nearly everything they want but they lose their fathers and their family life is missing. At that time children are influenced by their friends very much. So there is a dangerous of gambling, alcohol, drugs etc .
Gambling is important problem among young people. Gamblers need a lot of money to play games. They are dependent on the games in a while. They spend all their money and still need them. They are able to do everything to gain money for the games. Children often steal money at home. Dependance on gambling is something like dependance on drugs so gamblers are also treated in medical institutions .
Crime is connected mostly with money. Thefts, robberies, murders are realized especially because of money . ""Appetite comes with eating"" so crime is spread more and more because some people wants still more and more money. They are able to risk possibility to get in prison but their yearn for money is stronger. For example gangs, which are interested in stealing cars, have been increasing. We can ask why? The answer is that they have a large sum of money from this. It is unbelievable that someone can exchange a part of his life in prison for money. Even if they do not hesitate to use violence or murder anyone only for money .
Everyone is used to live in his living standart. Importance of having money we feel especially when we have not them enought. In this case we started to think up how money gets. People imagine that money can fulfill all their dreams. Actually it is truee but not at all. When you have a large amount of money you can buy everything, but you can not buy true friends, health, love of your wife, your husband or your children. By public opinion research in Czech republic, where people were asked to their value of life, we have known interesting things. In these years people's opinions have been changed. Importance of possessive has increased and overtook importance of education and hobbies. Result from this research is unpleasant not only for me. The people are not interested in education or hobbies but mostly in money. It never mind what a man does but the main thing is how much money he earns .
All people need money, it is natural. But important is how much they are able to sacrifice for money. Children suffer from their parents' work because they are all time in their job. Children having enough money can start with gambling. Then they need money more and more so they are able to commit a crime. People's oppinions have been changed in consequence of reaching money. Somebody has the only value which is money. Where a lot of money is, evil exists. Money and evil were and will exist. We must try to put it down .","All people need money, it is natural.",B1

But I couldn't communicate with English speaking people at that time. I learn English I want to speak more fluently. Although teacher taught me English to use textbook almost every day, I didn't remember of their lesson. So teacher should not teach by only textbook .
First, I think that teachers should help students to have their motivation. For example, they teach that English is good way of communication with all over the world or something. Because I still do not master English skill. It's not teachers fault. I didn't think strongly that I want to speak English in the future. So I think that their feelings help their study if students have motivation to English. Second, I think that most important thing is teaching English enjoyably. I think that students will become don't like English if teacher is so strict. And student will be bored by she or he teach in accordance with only textbook or examination. So I want that students will have interest in English. Then I prepare some materials for keeping student's concentration. For instance, the case of word test, teachers change usual test on paper to word bingo or games. Third, I think that English education of junior senior high school in Japan that take a leading part of grammar. Some of schools, which studying English for examination. Although grammar is important, I think that studying grammar is not perfect right way to be able to speak English. So after I teach one grammar point, students make sentence to use new grammar. I want to teach useful English in the future. For example, student will get opportunity of speak in the class or speak new grammar sentence. Therefore I need to create an atmosphere that students can open their mouth in the class. I think that students will have confidence to speak English if they keep on speaking since they are first year. Finally, I think that student should have listening ability. Because I can't communicate if I don't understand what the other person said even I can say my opinions or feelings. I thought that English is difficult when I was junior high school student. I think that I was afraid of English because I didn't get used to listening English. So students need to listen English because of they get rid of their feeling like mine. Therefore I think that teacher should have better teach to use Oral Approach. Teacher can use both of Japanese and English in that way .
I think that teachers have energy to teach for students. I heard that teachers often use negative word in the class. I think it is one of fact that students don't like or willing to study English. I think that it is fault of teachers to students can not understand. So I will not want to say that why do you understand. I want to be a teacher who has respect for each student and never gives up for teach. I want to teach English accurately, so that I should learn about English and other knowledge.",I think that I was afraid of English because I didn't get used to listening English.,B1
267_KRBF1014.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"There are many common things between mass media and religion. Mainly they both have addictive power on people, ability of binding people in one very intimate, and close group, however the most powerful influence they have is their controlling power. Their one word will affect on millions of people in every aspects, for example their life path, decision, life style, morality recklessly. So, where are the power is coming from? The power is coming from the fear of not being a part of the group, being a outcast, and being responsible fully for their action, and decisions. Therefore believing religion, and mass media can be seen as imputation of responsibility, reflection of human's major fear of loneliness, and the most effective way to control thousands of million of people. In this regards we can say mass media is new 20 century's religion .
	First, once mother Teressa said, [Quotation] . One of the most fatal reasons of human's death from ancient time to modern society is the depression coming from the loneliness. So hundreds decades ago, the easiest way to gather people in one group, and let them forget about the fact that we are all alone would be creating what people now call ""religion"". Likewise, these days if you don't watch TV, or read newspapers you can't really be part of the conversation with people. so now you ought to keep in touch with all kinds of mass media, to keep with people, and not to be a loner or a outcast .
	Second, religion and mass media are the most effective mechanism when it comes to control the people's behaviour. For example, people who believe in the bible, try their best not to go against what the book say. Rather than following their instinct, they go along with the path what the bible made. In this manner, if a magazine says that one certain fashion style will be a trend of this year, it will affect on millions of people's consuming tendency for the year. We are living in the era where one celebrity or news broadcaster's word can shake the coutry or whole world like Jesus did thousand years ago .
	Third, religion and mass media are the best things that we can impute our responsibilities, and sins. These days, most of new informations and ideas come from mass media which mean whatever we decide or think is mostly coming from mass media, so if something goes wrong because of my poor judgement or decision, we can alway blame media. Likewise, for example, in the middle age, people created a crusade war with, god's name. They justified their cruel murder with they god's name .
	In conclusion, religion, and media have so many similar aspects. They bond people into a group and give them an illusion that they are not alone, and they have enormous power on people, when it comes to control them, and brain-washing them, at last they also become excuses for human's poor behaviour. So basically, we can't live without them, but on the other hand, we shouldn't depend on them fully.","The power is coming from the fear of not being a part of the group, being a outcast, and being responsible fully for their action, and decisions.",B1
243_ITTO6003.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"One of the main problems of the last decade of our century is that of the feminist movement. Since the end of the eighteenth century women started trying to change their role in the society, but a real turning point seems to have been the sixties of our century. As usual there are people in favour and other against this movement. On one side stay people who think that feminists have just caused more problems to the society, for example creating a sort of confusion of roles between men and women and all the consequences that this confusion leads. On the other side are those who think that this movement have improved women's conditions, according to this idea their conditions have changed in better. Actually women went out their sort of jail in where they were obliged to live until our century: they started having their own ideas, they stared working, to vote and to have the same opportunities men have .
Women have ameliorated their way to live from many points of view: one is the act to think by their own, this is the first step to become independent, to have their own ideas about what is right or wrong for them is a good staring point for the movement. A second important point concerns the job: only working women can gain independence from their husbands and moreover can play an active role in the society; according this last idea, it is important to remember one of the biggest conquests that women have obtained, the right to vote, which allowed them to express their opinions about problems of the society .
More recently a revolt of the feminist movement took shape: during the 60's women reacted against the way society treated them, they claimed for more * independence from the house * they wanted to be something more than only a wife or mother, they did not want no more to stay at home waiting for their husbands, they wanted their husbands to help them with the house and the children .
Another reason of their revolt concerned discrimination at work, women were subjected to many falls: for example they could be faired because they were pregnant or they were subjected to sexual harassments by their boss and, in most of the cases, they were not recognized; moreover women could not denounce the falls because as a consequence they would have lost their job .
In conclusion feminists have made a lot of progresses in the last years; without any doubts women's conditions have improved thanks to this movement: today a woman has got quite the same opportunities a man has and most of the same rights, and what is missing it will be surely gain in the future .","In conclusion feminists have made a lot of progresses in the last years; without any doubts women's conditions have improved thanks to this movement: today a woman has got quite the same opportunities a man has and most of the same rights, and what is missing it will be surely gain in the future .",B1

May be it is the easiest way to feel ourself better in negative situations. We blame money for all evils since it can give people a comfortable life. Most of the people want to get it in an easy way and they commit all kinds of crimes for the evil money. Money enables gaps between people, it leads people to commit crimes; it causes deaths, it is the reason for people's losing their human values .
Money enables gaps between people. Yes, there are really gaps between rich and poor people. Rich people are respected by all the people around them. People address them restpectfully. It does not matter whether they are good or bad. The only important point is their being rich. People do not respect to poor people. Even poor are insulted by people around them. I saw people behaving tovards people according to their wearing. This is really a stuation to pity on. We are human beings but we neglect human values because of this evil money. I belive that rich people are lack of important values. They only order. They do not think the problems of people around them. This is not valid for all rich people but for the general. This situation is the same for all the rich nations too. They do whatever they want. They win the wars. They have more opportunities in agreements after the wars .
Money leads people to commit crimes. Everyday we are reading from the newspapers or watching on television the crimes committed for money. There is nothing that human will not do for money. Some people are robbing banks without hesitating. They do not care whether they injure people working there. Some are robbing people walking on the road. There are people who are breaking into houses to steal something. They are again giving harm both the people living in those houses and the goods in that house. They are doing all tese for money. People are sometimes committing crimes for very small things such as something to eat or something to wear but these are again because of being lack of money. Everyday such crimes are getting more and more commen. Because there is an economy problem at everytime in everywhere , so people are committing crimes. There was a broadcast on TV which was wery tauchy and a stuation to think about deeply. There was a family: parents and three children. The 
youngest child was very ill. He need an operation to survive and the operation was costing too much money to this family. Father was not earning enough money to pay for this. He tried to rob a bank but he could not achieve his goal. Police caught him. After this new, a few rich people helped them and the child had the operation. Some people are committing for they really need, but some are doing this for they have endless demand for money. Drug sellers are the best example of this situation. People are making smuggling or they are selling drugs to earn money. They do not think whether the drugs they sell giving harm to the young bodies or not. They only think the money they will earn in this illegal ways. As we see from the examples the demands are also killing the human values .
Money causes lots of deaths. We are again hearing and watching the people committing suicides because of the money. People especially businessmen who go bankrupt again finding the suicide as the only solution. People who have big economical problems are trying to solve their problems in the same way. In such situations people are living a great depression. They hate living. And they hate all the people around them too. They do not want to live anymore .
Money is also the reason for people's losing their human values. Especially rich people are lack of all the nice emotions. They only order they think they can solve all the problems with their endless money. This is general idea for rich people but it is not for all the rich people. People are also behaving each other according to their richness. Rich people are more important than poor people. Rich people are more respected ones. They are luckier everytime then others. I have heard that people are deceiving eachother by seeming as a lovely friend to steal eachother's organs in order to earn money. Yes, people are so bad when the subject is money .
Consequently everybody has a demand for money. This is normal because we need it to live, but the important thing is not to lose our human values for this evil money!",They win the wars.,B1
253_JPSW3009.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Now, it is said the internationalization society. The exchange with foreign country is active in a lot of fields. So it is necessary to study and use English that is common language. To study English is to understand different culture in the country where English is spoken. To understand different culture is to understand your culture again too. That is to say, you can have new view and a lot of ways of thinking. For the purpose, I consider how English should be taught .
It is important to make students have their motivation. There is a difference at the level and the speed on learning English between students who learned from the same teacher in same class. The reason for this is that there is difference in the motive in the learning environment of students. It is important factor for learner to have motivation. Then, how can we have students improve motive. First, from recognition states, we should give a clear objection (we should say today's contents at the beginning of the class.) and summary (at the end of class). Second, from affective states, we should give chance that students speak English in class and curiosity that is connected with motive. We should not use negative word. Teaching English in more positive attitude than a negative attitude brings students better learning results .
There are fifteen teaching methods for teaching English. Each method has both good point and weak point. These methods compensate each weak point. There is no perfect method. We should study correctly view and insistence of each method. It is necessary not to be prepossessed with one method, to assemble a lot of method. We should teach with method of suitable our own method in each case and suit level of students to our class. For example, Grammar Translation Method is a method that we teach rules of grammar and apply this to students and students translates from English to Japanese or translates from Japanese to English. Good point of this method is easy for student who uses fully Japanese to understand. Also, weak point of this method is that students can't acquire English operation ability because focus of class is translation and students can't study listening, speaking and pronunciation in class. This method is suitable for high level students. The load of teacher is light. Students can study writing and reading well. So, we should adopt only good point and compensate listening and speaking skills by other methods .
For carrying out this plan, we need to study hard everyday, for example, we should read English news paper and listening to English radio and watch English program TV. And apply ability for teaching students English. Before everything, it is important to think everything from the student's point of view and teach in a kind manner.",These methods compensate each weak point.,B1
052_CNUK1184.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"As you know, thousands of people would lose their lives everyday for lots of different reasons. Some are die of disease, some are die of the old age. Some are die from traffic accident, some are murdered, and so on .
However, we can avoid so many person lose their lives. Reasons of disease, accident and age that are can't control but we can stop the murder cases raising. We can protect the right of life. We can also forbidden the unfair matters happen by rules .
Even though, in the society, there are still so many reasons that make someone to kill a person. Take money for example, someone will lose himself, will lose the humanity, just in order to get more money. They just think about themselves, they just want to enjoy the life without any effort, they just want to get but giving. In a word, they are selfish. They are harmful to every member of society. Once they are arrested, they will be capital punished. That's no doubt. And no one will feel pity about that. People even will say that, "" That's the result they ask for.""
Besides the money, under the seduction of the power, murder becomes more and more common between two different governments or two organizations. In some foreign countries, many political leaders were murdered, just because their political opinions go against their own. Here, we can't tell which side is right or which side is wrong, but we are sure that, "" To kill a person or more just in order to build a new peace government, just in order to bring the fortune to people, all of these is not humane. It is even an excuse to clear the way for his own benefit. This case is also unacceptable. What's worst, this kind of case usually is abused by the whole world .
However, there is another kind of murder, which still needs discussion for the punishment. Why does it need discussion though it is illegal? Here, I will show the background to you. A cadre oppress the people with his power, and get much extra money from the people, who make the people live under a terrible sutuation. The people do nothing to him though they hate him very much. As days past by, this ill-treat makes people feel terrible. Finally, someone can't stand for him any longer and kill him. Well, he did a good job for people. And he would be praised by the people. But, from another point of view, he breaks the role, his behavior is illegal, he should be punished by the judge. In fact, the dead man is really not a good cadre, but maybe is a good husband or a good father. As his death, his families may go crazy, and couldn't live on normally. In another word, the murderer also did harm to people. Why do the people will agree to kill the cadre? Why do they will surport the murderer? That's because these people don't know much about the rules, and they don't know how to use the rules to protect themselves until they can't turn back .
According to this example, we can see that no matter for what reason, once you break the rule, you must be punished. If not, this world will become disorder, the life will be at danger all the time, the whole human being will stop developing. At least, human being will die out from the world. From that case, we also found a serous problem, that is, "" so many people are lack of knowledge about rules."" I think, that's the reason why so many people break the rules .
So, in order to keep the world peace, we must learn the rule and we must use the rule to protect ourselves. Besides, we insist that we will go on to punish the murder strictly no matter for what reason they kill a person .",We can protect the right of life.,B1
058_CNUK4011.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Feminists, belonging to the most arguable issues in nowadays, play a core
role of job - dividing and social status' forming. Those who support the
equality of male and female believe that feminists are good for women,
while others insist that what feminists have done to women is definitely
more harmful. The argument has been continued for several decades. Along
with the researches of the scientists, new evidences are revealed to give
the latter one stronger proves. Following are the details of this issue .
To begin with, feminists do have given female more chances to prove their
capabilities and creativities. In many working circumstances, women are
playing more important roles than men, or at least equal to men. However,
scientists claimed that there have been too much more working stresses
put on women resulting in the unharmonious between family members and
home violence. According to Jerry Z Muller (2003), nearly 30 percent
women are facing home violence or quarrels with family members result 
from too strong working pressure, which all come from the ideas of
feminists. Dr. Muller said that women are the most significant elements
of a specify family, whose hormone are secreted to keep everything they
may concern into a certain balance, to reduce potential quarrels. The
more attentions women pay to their job, the less they spend to their
family members. What the feminists done is already harmful to women in the
passed decades .
More over, another important difference between men and women is the
strength differences. Women's abilities of heavy work are less than
men's. This phenomenon results from the different amount of water
contained in blood of men and women, the latter contains more than about
15 percent as well as that of men, reducing the oxygen delivering
capability of female. So, it is not strange that men are more suitable to
carry heavy things. Hence, it is too arbitrary to carry out feminists
without concerning the differences between male and female, even though
men and women belong to the same species .
In addition, it is obviously that women are easier to feel tied than men .
It is proved by Mr. Muller that there are more red cells in men's blood
(about 20 percent higher) than that of women's. Since red cells' duty is
to supply the oxygen to the body cells, less red cell inducing women are
easy to get tire in general times. Appropriate concerns about the
different situations between men and women are good to improve the
efficiency of the latter's .
To sum up, though men and women are both human being, they are still quite
different from each other, not only as individuals, but also as two
different genders, which lead to the unlikely job adaptations and family
maintenances. What feminists did in the passed several decades is
definitely too arbitrary to reduce the inappropriate situations that the 
majority of female were facing. Although everything has both sides, the
pros and corns, which is just like a coin gets two sides, each one-sided
view is not justified enough, what feminists have done to female is still
more harmful in the course of women than good .","What the feminists done is already harmful to women in the

The prison system in Pakistan is really out dated. It is centuries old that was designed by the British against the Indians and the Muslims. Almost all the systems in Pakistan are those which were made by the British to humiliate and dominate the people of sub continent. In Pakistan this system of prison is centuries old and too bad. Rather it has reached to the level of worst. As police is associated with the prison system and the law and order system, so the corruption is at its highest level in these departments. So the prison system is also not free of this curse. The bribery is very much common is there in the prisons. The officials in prisons openly take bribe for various purposes. Even inside the prisons the drugs and arms can be found easily. There are officials involved in all these games. The prisoners are dealt with very bad methods. They are brutally tortured and there are different methods to be used to torture them. Mostly the criminals become more criminals when they leave jails and prisons. All this is because the prisoners are not treated as human beings. Rather they are taken as animals and non humans. The brutal torture and the company of further criminals make them rather big criminals. Even the facilities for prisoners are not good in prisons. The food the prisoners are given is usually substandard. The other facilities are also too poor and not up to the mark. The proper way to treat criminals is not to punish them severely. There may be other ways to treat the criminals. They should be rehabilitated. The system does not say to hate the criminals. But it says to hate the crimes. So the criminals should not be hated. Rather they should be given more care and attention so that they are not doing the crimes next time. This approach would give very much positive results and the crime rate may be reduced. D be some vocational trainings and courses in the prisons where the prisoner should be given chances to learn various things so that they may be able to do something when they leave prison. Similarly, there should be some psychologists in the prisons where the psychotherapy of the criminals should be done so that next time they don't commit the same crimes. The counseling may be the best option for them. There should be some system to educate the prisoners and criminals. The religious education should also be given along with the other education. The religious touch may prove more helpful to them to regain a normal life. The young criminals should must be kept separate from the professional and habitual criminals. Such criminals always mar the character of those young ones and take them towards the way of severe crimes. Similarly, the reasons for the crimes must be probed. The petty and minor issues must not be punished severely as it creates bad image on the minds of the youth and they become more accustomed to the crimes at larger level.

These facilities have began to be introduced in our society from industrialization which allowed a great improvement on the life of people . 
This progress brought with it a great change in economy, politic, science and society in general, but mainly in culture. People became fascinated to the progress of technology and then, so many inventions like telephone, computer, microwave, etc, transformed the life of people. All these changes came to improving the living conditions of population but they caused an acceleration of time. Nowadays, everything is so much faster and the velocity of information makes people have rapid access to facts which are happening around the world. Add to that the globalization is also a result of this all transformation . 
There are no doubts that inventions allowed a great development of the society but what did happen to feelings? What did happen to dreams? What did happen to imagination? Well, people are so much worried to acquire more and more material products, they are working in an uncontrolled way to get so much money to buy too expensive houses, last generation cars, last generation cell phones, high power computers, notebooks, etc, and the scientists works to make the best technologic discovery of the century. Anyway, people are living to get things, material things, but they are forgetting to live a real life . 
So, I think it is a wrong way to live. In my opinion, they are loosing the essence of life because all efforts are concentrated to technologic searches and natural values are in a second level. But, where are dreams and imagination? They are also concentrated to build an artificial world. It is obvious that there are exceptions but now population is thinking in an individual way. They are destroying nature in name of progress and scientists don't mind with the consequences of scientific researches . 
In the university, there are some courses that are considered theoretical and because of that they have less importance than the technological courses. It is a portrait of being thought. The courses that prepare students to think or the courses that claim imagination not application or courses don't prepare people for the real life, these courses do not have the same relevance than the others because the world needs the great technological discoveries and not only people that are thinking about the matters of society . 
One day, I read in the internet that the human imagination is what will allow us to control science and technology for human needs and I agreed with that, because nowadays we are more needs than dreams. Everything what we want, we easily get, everything is on our hand. By the way, science and technology exist to provide these needs and then, dreams are easily achieved. Because of that the life looses sense. So, it is also necessary to cultivate our soul. I think it is necessary to give more importance to relationships, nature and human beings.

These days, most of new informations and ideas come from mass media which mean whatever we decide or think is mostly coming from mass media, so if something goes wrong because of my poor judgement or decision, we can alway blame media. Likewise, for example, in the middle age, people created a crusade war with, god's name. They justified their cruel murder with they god's name .
	In conclusion, religion, and media have so many similar aspects. They bond people into a group and give them an illusion that they are not alone, and they have enormous power on people, when it comes to control them, and brain-washing them, at last they also become excuses for human's poor behaviour. So basically, we can't live without them, but on the other hand, we shouldn't depend on them fully.","Third, religion and mass media are the best things that we can impute our responsibilities, and sins.",B1
053_CNUK2008.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Why do people want to go to universities? Some people might say university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Well, in my point of view, people who said that might not be educated in university in their life. I admit that preparation for entering the real world is not enough for students in universities. But think about that, why those people with university degrees are easier to get a job? Doing degrees in university has both advantages and disadvantages .
The advantage of doing a degree in university is obvious. Why those companies want graduator of university? Because those people already have been educated in a high standard although in a very theoretical way. But theoretical does not necessary mean useless, instead, it is the experience of those people learned before, which can help university students preventing making the same mistake. Theoretical knowledge is totally not a bad thing. Let us compare to what happens in the real life, think about our driving lessons. I believe that pupils read awful a lot about how to drive before putting their hands on the steering wheel. Just like university degrees, they must pass the paper work like theory test then take a road test. People said that students get too much theoretical knowledge than practise. I do not think it is the weakness part of university education. Studying theory knowledge is the best way to prepare the coming challenge in the real life. The preparation to entering the real world is not just study theory test as well. As we are all university students, we know there is huge amount of research or business enterprise and all sorts of activity in the university campus. Within university you can meet lot of different people as well, just like the real world, people are coming from all over the country or even from different nations. What a chance to study different things! In the real world, we probably do not have those sorts of chance. So in my point of view, I think university is the best place to do preparation to entering the real world .
Of course, doing theory studying without doing practise is useless. In some university, it does happen which means when students enter into the society, it might cost them more time than others to be fit where they will be .
Anyway, I am a university student right now. I benefit from being a university student a lot and will be in my whole life .

479_TRME3019.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real life is a common lament of students which exactly represents human beings desire to find everything has been prepared by someone else for them to take the pleasure of. When it comes to the argument on the value of the university degrees , to make the value judgement we should make clear the answers of the following questions: What is it we name real life? What is main task of university education? And as the last question, what is the task of the student during the university education?
The term which we referred to as real life defines a complex structure within which a person may get into contact with different people with differing expectations and point of views. This variation in exectations and point of views causes various problems to come to the surface. Then if we want to find a solution to the above complaint about the universities inadequacy we need a university which gives the students a list of the possible human expectations and point of views. Furthermar, it should also be included in the list that which expectation and point of view brings about what sort of problem. Still, it is not enough. The solutions to verying problems should also be listed with a simple easily comprehensible style. That is not it! Such a thing can not even be called as utopia. Then what should be the contribution of university education to a student?
The surface responsibility of an university schedule is to supply the students with the theoretical knowledge of their department. This is the most visible but the least important task of a university education. The others, making the students gain critical thinking and problem solving abilities are the least visible but the most vital mission of university education. Students should be expased to as many different point of views about as many subjects as possible. Other than imposing certain truths the system should let the students to realize and criticise different views and construct their own point of views. The tendency of accepting all the things written on a piece of paper as changing truths should be demolished. If a person gains the ability of critical thinking then she becomes able to see the gaps not only in the point of views at other people but also in her own way of looking at life. Realizing the gaps and criticising meself brings together the change and development. A person who can develope oneself becomes a fully functraining person for the society and it beers at the same time personal satisfaction and happiness .
Additionaly, education in a university should not be taken as exposing students to a mass of knowledge to memorize. Students should not be lacked at the affective domain, they should be given the chance to apply what they be expanted to cognitive domain. This brings together the maturation of education process the role of the students also very big .
The first responsibility of a student is to determine the exact purpose of her university education. She should be able to apply her knowledge into her life and should be open to new ideas and should work really hard. She should also understand that nothing beautiful comes as ready in a big ornamented package in the real life. If one wants something she should give time and enough effort .
As a conclusion, the thing which we call ""real life"" is something really difficult to cape with to learn how to come over it no university programe, even the best one, is efficient enough on its own. The cooperation of the education system with students results in qualifed and skilfull students to graduate from university departments and any problem that they will come face to face in reality seems them as impossible to be solved because they would be skilfull enough to find alternative solutions to problems even the ones that seems to be impossible to come over, then the university degree becomes the most valuable thing to passess on the earth .",The solutions to verying problems should also be listed with a simple easily comprehensible style.,B1
301_LTVY4024.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Nowadays it seems that money is the most important thing in peoples' lives. The world became very materialistic, people seem to live to make and spend money. Madonna once said - ""We are living in a material world and I am a material girl"" and this truly reflects our society. Money means different things to different people: to some it is freedom, to others - nice things, to third - freedom, but the most important thing about money is the power, which is so desirable. The aim of this essay is to prove that words from old song ""Money is the root of all evil"" are true .

Firstly, money took over peoples' feelings. The world is full of rich men and women who are lost spiritually. Often seems that for most people money are more important than friendship, love or even family. People seem to forget what true things in the world are. People betray their family and friends for money, they lie, grovel; they are ready to sell their principles and themselves for money. Often young girls dream to marry a millionaire, preferably an old one, and get all his money when he dies. This shows how materialistic people are: they can sell themselves and also desire someone to die. People betray their principles, believes for money. Probably most people would sell their votes or take a bribe if there was an opportunity. When people get rich they often forget their friends, all true values in their lives. They become arrogant, snobbish, and associate only with people of high status in society. Another problem is that the human being is boundless and greedy. When he gets rich, he wants to become even richer and when he becomes richer he wants to become richer than that .

Secondly, all crimes happen because of the money. It seems that people can do anything to get money. They are ready to sell drugs, steal, sell people or even kill. Often when you want to get money, you have to take them away from someone. It is easier to get rich by stealing or selling drugs on streets than working legally all your life. Policemen and judges break laws by taking bribes. There is a problem of bribes in Lithuania in hospitals also. Money can cause such catastrophes as wars also. Wars happen most often because of the lands and profitable things like oil, gas and so on. Millions of people die just because of someone's desire to get enormously rich and powerful .

On the other hand, money cannot perform actions on itself. Money is just a tool. It is not the money, but people and their desire to be rich, get the status in society, power, is evil. That is why ""The love of the money is the root of all evil"" is the more correct form .

To conclude, the words from the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"" are true. Money causes a lot of bad things in the world nowadays. Because of the money and desire to get rich, people forget the true values: feelings like love, loyalty; their friends, family and principles, believes. People are very materialistic and they are ready to do anything in order to be rich and get some higher social status. Moreover, after they get rich they forget their friends and become greedy. What is more, all crimes, evil is being done because of the money. Money causes even such catastrophes as wars, where millions of people die. As money itself do not do harm to people, but people who wants to get rich and powerful are actually evil, more correct form of statement about money could be - ""The love of the money is the root of all evil"".","Wars happen most often because of the lands and profitable things like oil, gas and so on.",B1

287_LTVI2074.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"There is really popular these days to talk about equality issues. There are an immense amount of projects that suggest the society that people are born equal and the equality should be followed in every sphere of our life. Women are proposed to be equal to men, black equal to white, poor equal to rich, disabled to healthy, etc. There can be no way we can distinguish ourselves or others as better than somebody else. However, is it really possible to demand equality while we all are so different, or too different to be equal .

On the one hand, the idea of equality is really important in modern society. This dose not depent on a country or continent. Everywhere on Earth people are equal no matter whoever they do or whoever they are. What are the arguments to prove that Black people are better than White or vice versa? Moreover, why do we need such distinction at all? Who said that we should devide all the people in one class or another? By this division unequality is followed . If you separate something from something you naturally distinguish one better than another (otherwise you wouldn't need to separate). Our entire perception of the world is based on the idea that one is better or worse that the other. However, everything we believe to be better is just the matter of our stereotypes, it is just the framework we are living in, it is just the truth somebody sais to be truth. For example, once I met a British women that was (and still is) working with mentally handycapt people. She has mentally disabled brother as well. But when I asked her isn't she afraid that her children can be born with mental disabilities that could cause some major problem with having a baby and rising it, she said she would be really happy if her child could be born like that. According to Davida, she would be have her own baby no matter what anykinds of disabilities he or she would have, and she would be very happy becouse she knows how to talk to these people, how to communicate, she understands them, etc. This fact really collapsed all my understanding of the disability as such, as a phenomena. This really gave me an idea that all the normalities are ""normal"" only becouse somebody claims them to be normal. And everybody is equal or should be treated equal becouse that is what we are: equal .

But on the othe hand, the only possibility for the things to be equal is to be identical wich is totally impossible in our society. There no identical phenomena as well as people. Therefore, by identifying their differnces we give our opinion about them wich leads us to the conclusion that something is just better than the other. Even if we do so unintentionally we are still identifying something to be better. The equality phenomenon explained in such perspective gives us no doult that there can be no equality at all, equality is impossible to happen. Moreover, we can illustarte this phenomena in any kind sphere of life. Taking into consideration simple company of friends (or even a family) and business enterprise. It is obvious that in buisiness hierarchy there is only moral equality among people as any communication is based on the issues of the hierarchy. This is the best ilustration for my title of the paper: ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others"". Some workers are really more equal than others only becouse of their position and we cannot avoid that. Being (or trying to be equal) and reaching for equality would ruin all the company and buisiness. Even in the family affairs or our everyday we cannot be equal. If we take any friends' company where everybody is equal, in time some people would become closer friends and some would separate as it is the natural process of communication. Finally people would distinguish the others that thay like more and give them more privileges that other making them more equal. We can clearly see that there is no way of equality in our life .

To conclude, the idea of equality is very important in our everyday life. Everybody should be treated as equal no matter what they do or who they are. However, it is obvious that there is not such phenomena as equality. In todays world everything is based in your status in society. The degree of you, equality to others' depends on yor position in the world's hierarchy .","But when I asked her isn't she afraid that her children can be born with mental disabilities that could cause some major problem with having a baby and rising it, she said she would be really happy if her child could be born like that.",B1
048_CNUK1115.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In china, the PLA was consisted of only professional soldiers. But in many other countries, military service is compulsory and every citizen will have to proform as a soldier for several years. especially young university students. And in my opinion. military service should be compulsory .
There are several reasons why I think so. First, China, as the largest country of East Asia, had the widest borderline. To keep the whole borderline safe is not an easy thing. It need a large military force to be on duty all the time. But the soldiers sent to a certain place may not be familiar with the environment. Even they are professional soldiers, they may probably meet some troubles. If military service was compulsory, the border line can then be guarded by soldiers selected from local people who were familiar with local environment. And they can certainly do the job better than soliers from other places . .
Second, nowadays' young man are lack of life experience. They often care little about others and lack of discipline. Some of them even had never had any hardship and always waste things. Although Chinese government forced every university student to have a month's military training, it had little effect. People can't be changed in only a month. Comparing to these young man. those who had joined the army and serviced as professional soldiers are much more disciplinal and energetic .
So just imagine that if all the youngsters will have to serve in the military for several years, will it still be so many problems about youngster? 
Third, although the world is peace now, it still has the possibility of breaking out a war. And after so many years of disarmament, china's present military forces may not be enough for a war. But if military service was compulsory, those people who bad had military training can form a great military force at any time. That means almost every citizen can be the part of resistance to the invasion. Such things had happened once during the Second World War, when the Japanese army invaded China. At that time, almost everyone: soldiers, guerrillas and even citizens fought against the Japanese invader. And everyone may know that we won the war and defeated Japanese invader successfully .
Forth, armies formed by professional soldiers often developed slowly. Because every soldier had the same training and this made them always thought and acted in the same way. For this ""the army had few good commanders and new tactics. This will cause the army losing the ability of fighting. Now the PLA was starting a 
revolution, ""trying to avoid such situation. In fact, I think the best and easiest solution is to let military service be compulsory .
Although letting military service be compulsory has so many advantages, it also has disadvantages comparing to forming the army consist of professional soldiers .
For example: more money is needed to train soldiers, and soldiers may not as good as professional ones. But after all, make military service be compulsory can do good to not only the army ""but the education as well. That's why I choose it .",But the soldiers sent to a certain place may not be familiar with the environment.,B1
467_TRCU1072.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The education in university is important for many people all around the world and so many people are giving effort to take a place in university classroom. In addition to this three questions come in to our mind. Firstly, why do people want to go university? And then is the education given in universities enough? Does the universities really prepare students for the real world? I will try to answer these questions in this article .
The answer to first question is having a better job. The university degree provide people a statue and a chance to have a job wherever they want. When you apply for a good job, in a company the first question is wheather you have university degree or not. I think the reason of this is having many unemployment people and this is a good way to choose which person is more qualified. That's why you need a university degree. In contrast to this, having only degree is not a criteria . also, you should develop yourself too. When it comes to the second question which asks whether the universities' education is enough or not. Answer is both yes and no depending on department and quality of the university. Students learn everything about their department in class environment. Mostly they don't use what they have learned practically. In exams mostly theoritical questions are asked and students recite and answer .
Education is enough in regard to theoritical knowledge, on the other hand when it comes to practising they fail. Of course it isn't like that in each department of the university. For instance in Medical Department students take both theoric and practical knowledge. Especially during last two years they start to behave as a doctor. But in Engineering Department students make every projects on a paper. I didn't see an engineer candidate make a real robot or machine . If we think about teaching department practicum education is not enough. Whatever students learn important or unimportant, they have less chance to use them. They also attend practicum school but i think it is not enough. In lessons most of them can tell the course but it is different to teach young learners then advanced ones. I don't know whether there is a solution to this or not. Of course experts know better then me. As you see from the examples education in university are different in each department .
Third question looks for whether the universities prepaire students for real life. My answer is yes. Students cannot have practical knowledge. But university is a good chance for a person to grow himself and to learn how to stand on their own foot. University life have both happy times and tough times. Students may feel themself alone, bores , sort of money, crazy, strong, weak...etc. I have encountered all these situations in my university life. Moreover, students are trying to have a relationship with the people who have different characters. So that they learn hhow to tolerate people, not to trust everyone except themselves. However the most important thing is whatever you face, you learn how to stand on and how to survive .
To sum up, university is a part of our life. We have taken theorical knowledges and we have gone to school just the purpose of going but what we have gained is we have learned many things in university life without realizing. I don't agree that universities doesn't have value. In contrast, university has so much value in all over the world. Otherwise why do people spend so much effort to be able to a university student?",I don't know whether there is a solution to this or not.,B1
274_KRBF1062.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In the 20th century, TV must be one of the most affective devices which human beings developed. I was also watching TV everyday, and now I'm watching TV as well. For this reason, some people named it as an ""idiot box"". When people watch TV, they do not think or talk with their friends or family numbers. Even though there are a lot of positive aspects of TV, this kind of negative aspects seems to make TV one of the useless devices instead of a marvellous invention. Moreover, some psychologists insist that watching TV is one of the causes to get down emotional quotient which is the scale of human feeling in terms of outside stimulation. In some sense, this is very reasonable, but I would like to point out positive aspects of TV in human life .
	First, TV plays an important role of entertainers. At the moment, other media such as movie, music, and DVD are also popular for this purpose, but TV is the most popular one in human life. For this reason, TV has become the closest friend among other media in low cost. Particularly, among people who do not have enough time to enjoy various entertainments, TV is quite convenient in this point of view. Furthermore, TV can provide a variety of genres of entertainment such as sports, comedy shows, and so on. For example, Sky, satellite TV channel, presents all kinds of movies and sports in the world for 24 hours. Even though this 24 hour channel would provoke some problems in the educational perspective, it seems to be true that TV is full of excitement. Another role of TV in terms of entertainment is to combine all people in the world. For instance, Euro 2004 Football Championships is one of the biggest sports game attracting all people even in different continents such as Asia, South America, or Africa. Through TV, they are able to enjoy the best football games. This is not a sports game, but a festival for the world. In this perspective, TV must be perfect medium to deliver human feelings .
	Second, TV has an economic role because the majority of people watch it everyday. In the economic perspective, TV is a good tool of advertisement. Comparing with other media, TV has the most audience, so the market of TV advertisement is bigger than others. Like this kind of example, TV occupies a significant part of world economy. Another example in the economic point of view is ""TV Home Shopping"" which is a shop in TV. Since there are not actual shops, the price of goods is very cheap. For example, ""TV Home Shopping"" is one of the fast growing businesses in Korea. Moreover, this TV shopping is related to other businesses such as home-delivery service. Although TV has various roles in human society positively, there are some problems such as some people are addicted to watch it for shopping for a long time. However, it seems to be impossible to get rid of TV because of this kind of side effect in my opinion .
	In conclusion, the nickname of TV, ""idiot box"", could be accurate indication in some aspects. At the moment, many people are watching TV without thoughts, and they are changing channels as well. In some sense, this aspect of TV may affect human beings negatively, and break out the worst side effect they don't know. I don't want to deny this point of view, but TV also has useful aspects such as entertainment and economy. The question of if Marx were alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television seems to point out one side of TV which has various sides in human life.","Furthermore, TV can provide a variety of genres of entertainment such as sports, comedy shows, and so on.",B1

The prison system in Pakistan is really out dated. It is centuries old that was designed by the British against the Indians and the Muslims. Almost all the systems in Pakistan are those which were made by the British to humiliate and dominate the people of sub continent. In Pakistan this system of prison is centuries old and too bad. Rather it has reached to the level of worst. As police is associated with the prison system and the law and order system, so the corruption is at its highest level in these departments. So the prison system is also not free of this curse. The bribery is very much common is there in the prisons. The officials in prisons openly take bribe for various purposes. Even inside the prisons the drugs and arms can be found easily. There are officials involved in all these games. The prisoners are dealt with very bad methods. They are brutally tortured and there are different methods to be used to torture them. Mostly the criminals become more criminals when they leave jails and prisons. All this is because the prisoners are not treated as human beings. Rather they are taken as animals and non humans. The brutal torture and the company of further criminals make them rather big criminals. Even the facilities for prisoners are not good in prisons. The food the prisoners are given is usually substandard. The other facilities are also too poor and not up to the mark. The proper way to treat criminals is not to punish them severely. There may be other ways to treat the criminals. They should be rehabilitated. The system does not say to hate the criminals. But it says to hate the crimes. So the criminals should not be hated. Rather they should be given more care and attention so that they are not doing the crimes next time. This approach would give very much positive results and the crime rate may be reduced. D be some vocational trainings and courses in the prisons where the prisoner should be given chances to learn various things so that they may be able to do something when they leave prison. Similarly, there should be some psychologists in the prisons where the psychotherapy of the criminals should be done so that next time they don't commit the same crimes. The counseling may be the best option for them. There should be some system to educate the prisoners and criminals. The religious education should also be given along with the other education. The religious touch may prove more helpful to them to regain a normal life. The young criminals should must be kept separate from the professional and habitual criminals. Such criminals always mar the character of those young ones and take them towards the way of severe crimes. Similarly, the reasons for the crimes must be probed. The petty and minor issues must not be punished severely as it creates bad image on the minds of the youth and they become more accustomed to the crimes at larger level. No civilized society is in favor of punishing the criminals. Rather they prefer the system of rehabilitation. It is the rehabilitation which may help reducing the crime rate in any country.","Similarly, there should be some psychologists in the prisons where the psychotherapy of the criminals should be done so that next time they don't commit the same crimes.",B1

Infact the world of Scince technology and in dustrialisation help the main concept of the dreaming and the imagining world in abig way I'll give you an example, 30 years ago people wouldn't dream of communicating globaly with their counterpart from anywhere in the world. But thanks to the dreaming of people like Bill Gates who dreamnt of one day owning his own software / Computer Company which today is possible for us to communicate via E-mail of his computers .
We can travel anywhere in the world because have airplanes thanks to some one whoinitialy had a concept in his mind that one day he want to Create an airplane in order to assist people to travel anywhere in the world. So we can say that thinking and imagining is part of Scince and techology .
They go hand in hand in order for thinks that are good for industries to be established so that we can live better as people is this world .
I mean even Cellphones, telephones they were created by people out of their imagination before they were established physically.

Imean things become more easy even for people who comes from previously disadvantaged communities, door of thinking more and more are opened for thanks to Scince and technology even ifrestructure is accessed easily unlike in previous years were by if you had a poem you would have to write on a tree or stone to keep it in record .
Now you can write it on a piece of paper or preferably type in using keyboard ofacomputer thanks to technology.

058_CNUK4011.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Feminists, belonging to the most arguable issues in nowadays, play a core
role of job - dividing and social status' forming. Those who support the
equality of male and female believe that feminists are good for women,
while others insist that what feminists have done to women is definitely
more harmful. The argument has been continued for several decades. Along
with the researches of the scientists, new evidences are revealed to give
the latter one stronger proves. Following are the details of this issue .
To begin with, feminists do have given female more chances to prove their
capabilities and creativities. In many working circumstances, women are
playing more important roles than men, or at least equal to men. However,
scientists claimed that there have been too much more working stresses
put on women resulting in the unharmonious between family members and
home violence. According to Jerry Z Muller (2003), nearly 30 percent
women are facing home violence or quarrels with family members result 
from too strong working pressure, which all come from the ideas of
feminists. Dr. Muller said that women are the most significant elements
of a specify family, whose hormone are secreted to keep everything they
may concern into a certain balance, to reduce potential quarrels. The
more attentions women pay to their job, the less they spend to their
family members. What the feminists done is already harmful to women in the
passed decades .
More over, another important difference between men and women is the
strength differences. Women's abilities of heavy work are less than
men's. This phenomenon results from the different amount of water
contained in blood of men and women, the latter contains more than about
15 percent as well as that of men, reducing the oxygen delivering
capability of female. So, it is not strange that men are more suitable to
carry heavy things. Hence, it is too arbitrary to carry out feminists
without concerning the differences between male and female, even though
men and women belong to the same species .
In addition, it is obviously that women are easier to feel tied than men .
It is proved by Mr. Muller that there are more red cells in men's blood
(about 20 percent higher) than that of women's. Since red cells' duty is
to supply the oxygen to the body cells, less red cell inducing women are
easy to get tire in general times. Appropriate concerns about the
different situations between men and women are good to improve the
efficiency of the latter's .
To sum up, though men and women are both human being, they are still quite
different from each other, not only as individuals, but also as two
different genders, which lead to the unlikely job adaptations and family
maintenances. What feminists did in the passed several decades is

more harmful in the course of women than good .","This phenomenon results from the different amount of water

329_NOAG1013.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In USA, Europe, Australia and in Scandinavian, in countries with developed western culture and thinking, woman have achieved a positition that gives her all basic rights as regards to education and study, religious performences and believes, to ways of living and to work and career. Even in some countries legislation gives her preferences to certain political and work positions and statuses just because she is woman .
Besides this achievements, the woman has gained understandness and respect from men, as this is what the women's fight concerns about-the liberation from men's suppression .
This long women struggle to achive equal possibillities in life and living, respect both being a woman and a person is long time ago fullfilled in the western culture. Their faight is over. The feminists work is succeeded and all men agree that they have done a most marvelous and highly nessessary work .
However, we have seen during the two last decades that feminists objectives have turned into extremeties. Equally rights and respect and possibillities are no longer enough. Feminists objectives are now to be superior to men - in all aspects and on all levels. And if they do not fine goals to fight for at home, they find abroad, but fight them from save positions from homeland .
Not long ago I read an interveiw with a nearly fourty year old woman. She worked ver hard and long and ahs given career first priority. However, she sais that he had a man who had given her a child and to whom she was married .
This way of perform life and living, to look upon man's role has become common and fully acceptable today. Man's role is being a fertilizer fullfilling woman's prestige to give birth and prove her womanhood .
More and more women seems to look upon men as a practical object, useful to have at hand when needed for different purposes .
Asking young women today what they features and characters they prefer with a future husbond, they will strongly underline that he must be rich in money, have a good job, a nice house and a fast car, and that he must be kind in the sence that he is very generous to her .
Hard values as money, status and position, etc are today dominent preferences to men .
Looking women today you will observe more and more confirmity with women. Personal identity and individuality are disappering. This confirmities you now can see in women's behavior, dressing, attitude, living and careers, and not least in their personal appearence. It seems to men, very unfortunately that to look like a manis most popular. Sometime even an experienced eye hardly catch the difference, if the person you look at is male or female .
Idealistic struggles when loosing objectives to fight for, too often turns into exstremeties, and so also with the western feminists fights. Objects become more peculiar, and it now seems that the main object is to be superior to men. And to have the slightest possibillities to gain an objective as this, to gain attentions and support, the feminists fighters must exaggerate, and exaggeration leads to vulgarity. Bad behavior and living, swearing, drunkness, drugs, etc, etc, what earlier were men's ""exclusive privileges"" are now fully atapded and accepted by women and seems now more common among women than men. To be bisexual and to perform bisexualities makes you a modern woman and gives you prestige .
From men's point of view the feminists have turned or transformed women into unpersonal objects. It seems to men that modern women are not allowed - or not so free - that she does not dare show that she is a woman, dare not show her femininity. Modern feminism has made femininity something shamefull. Even better under Talibanlike regimes - at least you know that under this dress is a woman .
Maybe men are too romantic. But for more and more western men, the modern feminist struggles and fights and influence on women seems to have killed feminism and where are the feminine women. This kind of feminist behavior and performance make men run away in distress and frustration. Modern feminism will turn back upon the women themselves, as the man will not allow feminists to disturb his nature born basic instincts .
More and more western men turns their back to their native women and look for partners and wifes in other cultures where preferences and values are others, where he feels cared for and where home, children and family still are dominating and most valuables factor for live and living. Or expressed by five men I happened to meet in an East European county's restaurant some years ago: -""We are looking for a feminine woman - feminist we have enough of at home.""","It seems to men that modern women are not allowed - or not so free - that she does not dare show that she is a woman, dare not show her femininity.",B1
254_JPSW3011.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Speaking and listening are important. They are essential in communication. I think that English learning is not only to learn language but also communication. Speaking and listening are the very first step to master English, so we should have more conversation practices in class. I often hear that if we want to improve our English skills as soon as impossible, we should go to America, England, or Australia. In other words, if we listen and speak much as if we live in these countries, I'm sure we can improve English skills. I want to say again, we should have many conversation practices .
When I was junior high or high school student, I didn't speak English so much. Teachers spoke mostly and we students spoke only a little Japanese. I didn't have chances to practice conversations in English only a few times. It was not enough. At college I had ""speaking and listening"" class for the first time and I was requested to speak English during an activity in the class. I had not had conversation practice before, so I was very confused. What did the teacher say? What should I answer the question? Actually, I didn't catch even a very easy sentence, for example, !What did you do yesterday?"" Then, I wondered why I had studied grammar which was not so useful in communication. I always didn't like to study grammar because it was a little difficult to understand. Also, I learned it was not so useful. The fact was irritating for me. I felt I was a student who couldn't keep up with the others and the class level. I lost my motivation to study English. Now I don't feel so. Now I think grammar is also important. But I learned from my experience that if he or she feels what they studied is useless, they will lose their motivations and stop to improve their skills .
We should have many practices of conversation and speeches in earlier education, junior high school. If they are not successful, it is OK! Failures or mistakes are good rather than successes, because we will have many mistakes during communication. Important thing is how we can solve the problems. Failures will lead to successes .
Also, the atmosphere is so quiet in class. It is difficult for students to ask questions or say their opinions in such a quiet place. If they don't speak English, they will never be able to speak it. To say own opinions is very important in American culture. Teacher should tell about it and pay attention to atmosphere of class. English should be taught in cheerful atmosphere and we should have many, many practices of conversations .","I want to say again, we should have many conversation practices .",B1

438_SPM04048.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"From the beggining of the society there are the problem of the money. All the people wants to be richer than his neighbour. People accept jobs according to how many they pay him but not according to his preferences. People tends to think that the more important is the money but they tell you that it is the health .
Money is the real problem of the society in this world, because it determines the great real problem in the society nowadays: the avarice. But it is not a problem that only appears now, but it is a problem who begins since the man is a man. When the man thought like an animal, he still have the instinct of survice, with no matters if other person lived better than him. He changed his elephant peel for a hen, without thinking if, maybe, the the peel could have more value than the hen. He thought: ""I needs this hen in order to survive, and, as I don't need this elephant peel I could change it"". But, in a indeterminated moment of the history of the human beings - it would be interesting that the cameras had record this moment-, one man said ""my peel is most value than your hen, if you want me to give you this peel, you will have to give me two of your hens"" - even knowing that it would be worse for the three children of the man. This poor man accept the change, and from this moment begins the avarice. This fact could make us thing that the real guilty of the beginning of the greed was... the man who accepted the first avaricious treat, but it would be accept that all the humanity is guilty and... it's so true .
It's so true because only a very rather small group of people has denied to following the rule of the greeds. And we can see it along the history of the humanity, and it is the reason why we following with the rough history of the world .
The people who begin to restore the avarice in the world sow that the best vehicle to keep that has born: the money. We can think that the reason of the creation of the money was good, in order to value the things you need and to prevent people to buy things according to its prize, but as the good ideas uses to finish in bad results, as we can see with the invention of the powder, the result is a invention, that instead of help society, damage it .
People left his desires and became to work in those work where they can buy more money. This wasn't very dangerous if some people doesn't follow this parameters, but the 99% of the population of the world begin to believe to this way of live ""less pleasure and more money"". This situation produces that people who coudn't earn the same money as their neighbours, get greed, and even they would not tell you nothing about it, they didn't mind if their neighbours didn't earn so much money .
But this fact doesn't finish here, because people, when they have a relevant and important work, they treats to better their entrances making ""dark business"". This phenomenon is relevant nowadays, as we can see in countries as Spain, Itally, EE.UU. or Great Britain, where politics, don't agree of what they want, prefer to put in dangerous his liberty in order to buy a luxury apartment with two hundred bathrooms. Then people thinks: ""if the politics, who had teorically to be honest, because they represent the whole country, they don't, then, why I cant do it!"". Then, people begins to declare to the government less than they really earns, and the snow ball begins to be more and more big .
Children will born in this state of greed, and from the beginning, they will prefer the money instead of the love of his family and this will produce a lost of the old values, than, even when we thinks that this values don't help us and it would have to be changed by new values, they help us to keep a bit of humanity in our souls .
If this ball keeps its rhythm, we will return back to the wilderness, because wars will be more frequent than nowadays, and we will live as animals, with only a diference, animals never hurts animals of his own blood .","Money is the real problem of the society in this world, because it determines the great real problem in the society nowadays: the avarice.",B1
466_TRCU1065.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Today, universities whose numbers are more than thousands all over 
the world are significant education institutions that educate people
according to profession fields. So which factors make these education
institutions so important? Maybe the first factor is that it educates human, 
the other one may e its professional education, and third one is most
probably its academic characteristics .
The quality of education of a country goes together with the 
development level of that country. If universities' goal is to prepare the
people according to their professions, their first target should be to make
these people professionally competence. Therefore; the education system
is very important . "" How to supply education to the students? "", "" Should 
the students be directed to the memorization? "", "" Should the students deal 
with unnecessary items? Or ""Should they take knowledge related with the 
real life and abstain from extras? "" 
It is wrong to put all universities in the same boat. I am talking
about the most of them. Today in many universities the education is 
presented to the students theoretically. The students are rather passive
many times. They come to the class, just listen the lesson and then go .
At the end of the lesson most of the knowledge they acquired is staid on the
notebooks. However, if they were presented the lesson practically not
theoretically, the knowledge will be more permanent in their minds. They will
be willing to have that lesson again, get more pleasure of it .
In my opinion the knowledge which is learnt theoretically, is exposed 
to be forgotten and its permanence is very little value. However, I think if we 
present education in a practical way and enable their participations to the
lessons, it will be more permanent .
This example will enlighten you. Suppose that you are asked for your 
comments about a country or a city which you have not been and not seen .
But you are limited what you have already read about it. Besides suppose 
that you have been or seen that country or city and had experience of it .
In which way would your comments be effective? Can you see the 
difference? 
We can see this difference in our country ' s universities more clearly .
Many lessons in most departments are unrelated with preparing the
students to the real life. The students are surrounded many unnecessary 
knowledge. So how much of these knowledge will be acquired in their 
profession life? When will the individual apply to these unnecessary
knowledge? This is nothing more than consuming time and labor .
I have mentioned about the balance between the quality of education 
and development of a country at the beginning of my essay. Let ' s talk about 
it some more. There is no need to discuss the importance of the education in
determining the fate of the country. If you look at the improvement projects 
of the countries, you can see the innovations that will be done in the field 
of education at the top of lists. The universities whose aim is to educate 
qualified people should set up their own education policies regarding to 
these criteria. Unfortunately, this lack of the universities effects not only 
the fate of countries, but also the history of human. Have you thought 
about this problem before? 
We are in the technological era. We are making our lives easier and 
more practical by means of the innovations of the technology. So why do not
we enable this practicality in the education system? The universities' aim 
should be educating people for the sake of the development of whole world .","We are making our lives easier and

If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television."" By this statement we are informed with Marx's views about religion. Marx was the father of modern communism. He was born in 1818. In his intial age, he was jew by religion. Later on, he turned his views to materialism. He presented his political and economic philosophy of class struggle envisaging replacement of capitalism with socialism . 
His communist views caused of dialectical materialism. According to his theory the course of history is the evalutionary development of the conflict between opposites. It considers the present day condition of the world as the result of a class struggle between the capitalists aiming at private profit and the proletariat who do or should resist exploitation at their hands . 
Being a man of materialism, he is adverse to religion. According to him, religion has no importance in making a man's life happy and successful, it is rationalism may lead a man on a successful way. But fact is not that. He is quite false in his views. All his arguments about religion are based on prejudice. He prefers materialism to religion inspit of its all defects. It is materialism which has snobed the moral values of man. Man has fallen down from animal level. It is only for the reason, that he has been free from religion. It has resulted into rising corruption and other social evils in society. In this regard the instense of Japan can be given which is the biggest economic power of the world but is at the first number committing suicede. The people of the countries where religion is an unnecessary mater, has deprived of inner peace and smooth . 
Religion is the intuitive voice of man. If body of man is needed for food, the soul of man is also needed for the acts of virtue. Otherwise there is not any difference between human and animal. Even the cave man was a religious one. He also worship his own god. The history of religion on the earth as old as man. A person who believes in God never be disappointed. He fixes his eyes to the God in every situation. This thing produces in him optimism. Contrary to it, materialistic person is pessimistic. It may consider the religion responsible for strife in the world, because many fights are fought in the world on religious views. He also may consider that religion brings many restrictions in its wake in man's freedom. But we can not accuse the religion a cause of strife in the world because if we know without prejudice we shall come to know that every religion preach its followers to live peace and tolerance. It is human nature which urges him to dominate the other nations . 
In short, like Carl Marx any thinkers have presented their views against religion and have attempted to slip out the image of God form massess's mind but inspite of all, they failed bitterly in their purpose.

So, I put emphasis on speaking rather than grammar to the beginning learner. Until quite recently, systems of education in Japan have a course such that teachers teach students grammar and vocabulary at the beginning. Recently, we come to have a little opinion of this course. An educational institution put forward that speaking is also important, and teaches should teach grammar and vocabulary and speaking. As compared with another foreigner, speaking is a weak point than writing and reading for Japanese . 
Now, English is introduced at junior high school in Japan. But, other foreign country is introduced English or other foreigner at primary school. In Japan, introduction of English is too late. I should think when children start school, children should learn English at the same time, and children learn other subject .
 I should that the emphasis is on play and enjoyment, rather than formal language teaching at primarily level. So, I want to use task and activity in everyday lesson. I think that students are able to fluent. Teachers teach students formal English or accuracy little by little. Fluency, accuracy and complexity are not learned together. Until now, curriculums of Japan emphasized accurate rather than fluency. A result, Japanese is not fluency rather than other foreigner. Because Japanese stand to attention grammar and mistakes so as to make mistakes. So, students learn fluency accuracy and complexly in sequence. That is to say learners can fluent, teachers teach grammar and reform mistakes. After that teachers teach complexly step by step .
I should think that teachers accept using English to teach other subject in curriculums at primary and second level. For example, at primary level teachers adopt incorporating English vocabulary and simple phrases, sentences and instruction into every day classroom. At the secondary, teachers use English as much as students can understand in other curriculums. Of course, teachers should use English all the time in school lesson .
I think that learner should start studying as soon as possible, and they should enjoy studying foreign language. So teacher give students to teach English with enjoyable. I don't teach grammar or vocabulary but attention of foreign language. Because, I am happy when I could have a communication with other foreigner. And I think that communication is very important. If I will a teacher, I teach students English of real situation, and I use tape recorder because of commune with natural to English. It is important that students think to enjoy studying English.

method death comes quickly. The electric chair is another way. The exact time 
of death is unknown but four to ten minutes is reasonable. Firing squed is 
the most disgusting. The gas chamber takes various minutes of misery agony

human is given by God and it is right to be killed by God. On the other hand 
some people believe that paople should punished according to the rule ""eye 
for an eye"" but it is very cruel .
In every where people are given capital punishment because of their 
illegal behaviours such as murdering and adultry. However it is not a good 
solution to prevent people doing such things. This is just made because of 
man's blood lust and need for revenge. As [Reference] But killing

Life is a present from God to human. God gave it and God should get 
it . [Reference] 
By giving capital punishment, also the government make a negative effect on

Another reason not accepting capital punishment is that the person who is 
sentenced may be innocent. A person's life shouldn't be relied on a person's 
words coming from his/her mouth. In countries where capital punishment is 
used, this means that the value of their lives depends on their race and the

sentence in prison is a good alternative punishment instead of capital 
punishment. Also this punishment (life sentence in prison) much more cheaper

May be it is the easiest way to feel ourself better in negative situations. We blame money for all evils since it can give people a comfortable life. Most of the people want to get it in an easy way and they commit all kinds of crimes for the evil money. Money enables gaps between people, it leads people to commit crimes; it causes deaths, it is the reason for people's losing their human values .
Money enables gaps between people. Yes, there are really gaps between rich and poor people. Rich people are respected by all the people around them. People address them restpectfully. It does not matter whether they are good or bad. The only important point is their being rich. People do not respect to poor people. Even poor are insulted by people around them. I saw people behaving tovards people according to their wearing. This is really a stuation to pity on. We are human beings but we neglect human values because of this evil money. I belive that rich people are lack of important values. They only order. They do not think the problems of people around them. This is not valid for all rich people but for the general. This situation is the same for all the rich nations too. They do whatever they want. They win the wars. They have more opportunities in agreements after the wars .
Money leads people to commit crimes. Everyday we are reading from the newspapers or watching on television the crimes committed for money. There is nothing that human will not do for money. Some people are robbing banks without hesitating. They do not care whether they injure people working there. Some are robbing people walking on the road. There are people who are breaking into houses to steal something. They are again giving harm both the people living in those houses and the goods in that house. They are doing all tese for money. People are sometimes committing crimes for very small things such as something to eat or something to wear but these are again because of being lack of money. Everyday such crimes are getting more and more commen. Because there is an economy problem at everytime in everywhere , so people are committing crimes. There was a broadcast on TV which was wery tauchy and a stuation to think about deeply. There was a family: parents and three children. The 
youngest child was very ill. He need an operation to survive and the operation was costing too much money to this family. Father was not earning enough money to pay for this. He tried to rob a bank but he could not achieve his goal. Police caught him. After this new, a few rich people helped them and the child had the operation. Some people are committing for they really need, but some are doing this for they have endless demand for money. Drug sellers are the best example of this situation. People are making smuggling or they are selling drugs to earn money. They do not think whether the drugs they sell giving harm to the young bodies or not. They only think the money they will earn in this illegal ways. As we see from the examples the demands are also killing the human values .
Money causes lots of deaths. We are again hearing and watching the people committing suicides because of the money. People especially businessmen who go bankrupt again finding the suicide as the only solution. People who have big economical problems are trying to solve their problems in the same way. In such situations people are living a great depression. They hate living. And they hate all the people around them too. They do not want to live anymore .
Money is also the reason for people's losing their human values. Especially rich people are lack of all the nice emotions. They only order they think they can solve all the problems with their endless money. This is general idea for rich people but it is not for all the rich people. People are also behaving each other according to their richness. Rich people are more important than poor people. Rich people are more respected ones. They are luckier everytime then others.

241_ITTO5008.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In all probability university students wonder whether or not they spend their time uselessly in studying through four or five years in order to take their degree. it is necessary to underline that there are some university degrees which are more theoretical than practical and which aim more at enriching culturally student ' minds than preparing them to enter the real world. The university degrees which are more theoretical than practical are the Art Faculties degrees such as degree in History, Philosophy, Modern and Classical Languages; on the contrary university degrees which are more practical than Art Faculties are Medical Faculty, Engeneering Faculty and Business Administration Faculty .
The degrees in Medicine and Business Administration give the possibility to students to do training courses in hospitals and in enterprises in order to help them to become more familiar with the world of business. Take the instance of Arianna Cataldo, a friend of mine who last year took her degree in Business Administration and now works as secretary in an enterprise in Turin. During her four years university course, she had to do training courses in different enterprises where she learnt to use computers and to keep enterprises accountings. Consequently, last year when she obtained her degree, she quickly found a job as secretary in one of the four enterprises where she worked during training courses .
In the medicine Faculty, students are obliged to do practical courses in hospitals, in fact it is not sufficient to pass all theoretical exams to get a degree in Medicine. Take the instance of Marcella Vittorini, a friend of mine who would obtain a degree in Medicine. Every day she does practical hours at the C.T.O Hospital of Turin. She tells me that practical hours are very usefull in order to understand better medical theories and to understand in what consist the doctor's work. She find practical courses very important in order to become more familiar with her future work .
In general, Arts Faculties initiate students into the teaching career. People are persuaded that being a teacher is easier than being a secretary and consequently they are convinced that practical courses are unnecessary. Take the instance of Jane Morris: ten years ago Jane got a first-class honours degree in history at Cambridge University and two years ago she found a job as history teacher in a Secondary School in London. Last year she was dismissed because the students complained to the headmaster about the fact that she was not able to explain the historical events .
She never explained History but obliged her students to study it on books by themselves .
Consequently, the dismissal of Jane gave rise to controversies about the fact that the Humanities degrees are more theoretical than practical . Final year students should have the possibility to do temporary teaching jobs or should work as teachers' assistants in order to become more friendly with students but above all with the subject which they are going to teach in future .
As far as modern languages degree is concerned, it lacks in specialized courses which may be useful to students who are going to find a job as interpreter in enterprises. the languages courses focus their attention more on literature than on language. In fact there are more literature exams than language ones. Moreover there are not courses about Business English, Business French, Business German or Business Spanish which I consider essential in order to find a job as interpreter .
furthermore, there are no computer courses or courses specialized in translations. When you have an interview the employer does not ask you to talk about Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde, but he usually asks you whether or not you know how to use a computer and whether or not you are familiar with business English, for instance. Take the instance of my aunt Emilia. She took her degree in English language ten years ago. When she went for an interview, she was not recruited because she was unfamiliar with Business English and computers. The employer preferred to recruit a girl who only held a school-learning certificate but who was excellent in using computers and in writing Business English .

Feminism, what is it actually? It is the struggle of women for their rights the dictionary informs us. So at first sight there is no harm in it. Let's have a brief look at the history of its development .
The end of the 19th century - women are bored and tired of sitting at home, knitting, washing , bringing their children up and waiting for their husbands who spend all their time at offices earning for the living. It is not a very cheerful picture, is it? And who will judge poor women for their innocent desire to vary their monotonous lives a little?
What do we observe now, just several decades later? Women study at universities together with men, they wear the same clothes, take an active part in politics, they go in for sports, they even fly into the space .
They are likely to have achieved everything they dreamed about .
But amazingly they do not stop. They dug deeper and found things which they called "" discrimination "" and "" sexism"".
A man opens a door before a woman and she is insulted. She can do it herself, she does not also let him pay for her at the restaurant. She earns enough to do it herself. There will be millions of such examples. And finally what do we have now? Men treat us as if we were men. They forgot what it is to be a gentleman .
The relations between men and women became simply like in the stone age. And when some women who are far from the idea of feminism try to protest men always have a ready answer: "" But you wanted it yourselves "" .
I think that the cause of feminism gave us, women, a lot, but today it has gone too far. There must not be extremes - that is a golden rule. Unfortunately feminists do not understand it , as they do not understand how ridiculous they and their ideas are .
"" We are no worse than men. We want to have everything men have.""
That's a phrase frequently used by them. And gradually they become like men: very rude and not elegant at all .
I don't know about the others, but I want to be a woman, and I want to feel in the presence of men. And I am absolutely sure that most of today's women do not want to have anything in common with today's feminists, who, probably, are establishing the 3rd class now .
So let them fight for their ideas, but don't let's us, women, be taken by them .","Unfortunately feminists do not understand it , as they do not understand how ridiculous they and their ideas are .

321_MDCM3048.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The technology has developed tremendously over the past decade. Thanks to technology our lives are much easier. Transport, for example, is a lot better and much more affordable. Entertainment is another aspect of our lives that has seen a great improvement. Construction industry has also experienced the benefits of the developed technology. However, when we think of technology nowadays we think of smart phones, computers, tablets. This modern technology facilitates our lives. But where are the children in this whole picture. How does it affect them? Technology negatively affects their imagination and dreaming, as well as creativity . 
	Let's first focus on how children learn. Children notice everything that surrounds them. They notice new ideas, new concepts and try to understand them and construct knowledge of them. Children born in this digital era are surrounded by technology so their brain develops in accordance to these concepts. That is why it is a no surprise that a 3-year old child can use a smart phone or a computer. The statistics show that 90 per cent of the 14-year old children use a mobile phone. Also 56 per cent of the children who are at the age of 10 to 13 years own a phone and even 25 per cent of the children who are at the age between 2 and 5 years have a phone . 
	The first point is how technology affects children's imagination and dreaming. In today world of technology there is no need for imagination. If we compare children born a decade ago to children born the past few years, we may notice a difference in their imagination and dreaming. The reason for this being the source of entertainment they had. Let's say toys, for example. They had the opportunity to express their imagination through those toys or even without them. Children used their imagination to entertain themselves. Now the technological inventions are becoming more and more popular and far more interesting to children. Only through one click on the computer or the tablet the children have access to many different ways to entertain themselves. There is no much room for imagination and dreaming here. Everything has been already done for them. What is concerning is that sometimes the parents are those who impose the technology to their children. One excuse for this is to keep them busy and another excuse is that the children do not have another entertainment. This should not be an excuse to impose technology to children because there are many things apart of the technology that can be much more entertaining and at the same time enhance their imagination.
	The second point is the effect technology has on creativity. Studies have shown that creativity is innate, children cannot lose their creativity. However, if it is not looked after, it can be suppressed. The internet offers a great amount of information. New information is uploaded every second. Children know that everything they need is available on the internet. Now since they know where to find what they need, there is no place for creativity. This in turn leads to lack of effort to remember things. Knowing that the necessary information is available on the internet, children do not bother to remember it. There had been a research conducted in 2010 on creativity and the results had been compared to those in 1970s. It had been found out that there was a decrease in American children's creativity. Children in 2010 could not produce as creative ideas as could children back in 1970s . 
	In conclusion, technology has a negative effect on children's imagination and creativity. However, children cannot and should not be stopped from their exposure to the technology because technology is not here for a short period of time, it will stay here forever, people cannot escape it so cannot children. That is why children should be led into the technology world carefully. It is certainly that they should be exposed to technology but the technology exposure should be balanced with other types of activities like reading and outdoor games which will stimulate their imagination and creativity and at the same time prepare them for the today technological world.",That is why children should be led into the technology world carefully.,B2
193_HUEL4053.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The rapid spread of technological devices is one of the greatest problems of our time.
The proper regulations regarding the use of these devices are still lacking. While many such instruments are silent and discreete, mobile phones can be disturbing, indeed. There are restrictions in theatres, cinemas, libraries, etc., however, it is considered to be a problem that many people use their mobile phones on means of public transportation. This problem could be solved, if the use of phones was prohibited on vehicles of public transportation.
As there are people who ignore regulations that are unwritten, these should be created on a legal basis. For this reason, a law should be passed, regulating the use of mobile phones, including and detailing, the restrictions of using mobile phones on means of transportation. Enforcing the regulations should be the common issue of local governments and the companies responsible for maintaining the public transportation systems.
While nearly everyone now owns a mobile phone, there is a large number of people who would renounce their use of these devices during the time spent on means of public transportation. Considering the opinion of both sides, it still remains true that the loud conversations, often related to the private life of the owner of the phone, are disturbing. The other travellers may consider this behaviour uncomfortable, inappropriate, and even uncouth. Meanwhile, it also takes away the privacy of the speaker's life, disclosing information that would not belong to public attention. This may cause psychological problems over a long time.
Besides these nervous problems, it has often been stated that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by devices, such as mobile phones, may have harmful effects on one's health. This concerns the owner of the phone, as well as those in their immediate surroundings. Even though this effect is not proven as fatal as the effect of active and passive smoking, the time available for the research has not been enough for a definite conclusion. The health hazard, however, should not be ignored, and it should be taken into consideration, when making a new regulation.
It can be cited. as a disadvantage that in our information-dependent society the prohibition of the use of mobile phones on means of public transportation will have negative effect on business life. This, however, is an exaggeration. The primary means of information transmission now rely more on local and global computer networks, as these provide users with more possibilities, while keep the level of redundancy and noise as low as possible. The partial prohibition of using mobile phones, while may be uncomfortable, will not cause severe problems.
Considering the arguments for and against introducing a prohibition of mobile phones on means of public transportation, while the possible problems are clear to all, the step is needed, and should be taken. This would later be supplemented by additional solutions, but the advancing of modern technology requires immediate regulations regarding these devices.","The primary means of information transmission now rely more on local and global computer networks, as these provide users with more possibilities, while keep the level of redundancy and noise as low as possible.",B2
328_NOAC1017.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"There are almost 2 million Americans in prisons in the U.S. today. Many of these criminals go in and out of jail their whole life. Prisons are the perfect school for criminals. They can go in with a ""Bachelor"" degree in stealing cars, and then a few years later they can come out with a ""Masters"" degree in narcotic smuggling. The criminals often share information ""in the joint"" about what they know best, usually criminal stuff .
What can this world give the criminals in prison after they have served their time? It is hard to imagine how it must be. Serving years behind bars and then trying to blend in to our society. First of all, things change and the life they knew isn't the same any more after all those years. They have to adapt to ""our new"" world. This must be very difficult for them. Getting a job is important, but who wants an ex-criminal with a criminal record to work for them? If they fail getting a job, they often do what they know they do best, criminal stuff .
The prisons system should help the prisoners to get a new start in life. Help them with a college degree, or train them to be able to get some kind of a descent job after they are done serving there time. Let them work and feel that they are a part of something important and are needed in society. But most of all show them there is more to life than being a criminal. It is possible to make descent money doing ""normal"" stuff .
The most important issue to help prisoners with, that will later live in our community, is to help them understand that they cannot keep on disobeying the law. Everybody should be able to talk to a psychiatrist, or some person that will help him or her in his or her situation they now have to serve time in jail for .
Putting the prisoners ""away"" in jail cells will usually not help the prisoners, especially later on in life. After being stuck in a cell for many years, like an animal in a cage, away from any kind of freedom, the prisoners will probably have more problems when they get out, than when they where put in .
The jail system needs to be changed. For thousands of years we've locked criminals up in prisons. There have to be other solutions .
There is a reason why criminals get caught for something illegal again and again and are put back in jail. But why anyone would dare disobeying the law ever again after serving time in prison, is outrageous, but happens too often and shows that serving time in prison does not help nor change the prisoners lifestyle .
A descent job would definitely be a huge lift for them in changing their lifestyle. That is why they need help in prison, talk to psychiatrists or people who can help them and working so they can feel good about themselves and not wanting to go back to there old lifestyle as criminals .
All of these issues are depending on one thing. Money. The taxpayers are the ones who will suffer for all the ""help"" the criminals in prison will need.

I will here focus on the sex equality. There are a number of different ways to proceed in this work. One way is the feminists' way, by trying to build a wall between sexes and to accuse the men for the history. To say to a man that he as a man is responsible for all evil that men have done and do, with sexual abuse, war and violence, will not help anybody. Even if the feminists might not think that they really accuse the single man, I know men that feel accused for what other men have done, but do not feel more responsible for that than any woman. Instead, they themselves feel trapped in a role that they have not chosen, like many women feel this way. Therefore, I feel that in some respects the feminists have done harm to the cause of women, even if they by doing this have focused the problem, which of course is of importance .
Even if the feminists' way was the right to start with, to make people aware of the problem, their way is not the right anymore. I don't feel that it is leading to my goal in this question. My goal is to get mutual understanding and respect between people, independent of sex. For me, it is important not only that women get the same chance in working life, but also that men get the chance to take care of their children. In this chance is of course also a responsibility for women as well as men. Women have to take and get responsibility at work and dare to take the chance when for example offered to be promoted. This includes that the other women at the workplace support the woman that dared instead of saying that she is not good enough, because I think that there are higher demands on women than on men in the same position. It also includes that men accept women as bosses and accept to give them responsibility as well as pay them the same salary as they pay men with equal work. At the same time, men have to take more responsibility for the every day things in a household. This is a question of women letting the men take the responsibility as well as a question of the men taking it. If we respect each other as equal and try to help each other and to take responsibility in all aspects of life, I think it will do good to the cause of women as well as the cause of men .","Even if the feminists might not think that they really accuse the single man, I know men that feel accused for what other men have done, but do not feel more responsible for that than any woman.",B2

Nevertheless I think money can claim being number one in that matter! Let us think of the influence money has at the level of the individual, and then at the more general level of the country .
In our merely materialistic world, money has gained such a high status that nearly reaches the level of moral value such as trust, good morality. Indeed it has become one of the criterias on which people set up judgments about the moral qualities of others. Money can even be considered as a kind of synonym for honesty, courage, intelligence, ... Moreover it is also considered as a key to success, and, therefore, as people believe, a key to happiness, which is the quest of most of us. From the moment someone finds it, envy and jealousy arise. And as bad thinking is not far from bad action, we can easily explain a high rate of thefts, hold-ups, attacks,... That has also its effect on the atmosphere and relationship between people : discomfort, fear, distrust, ... From another point of view, money causes problems in the way it is not fairly shared out among people. In other words we have rich and poor people. That raises the question of equality among men, injustice and ostracism also find expression in frustration, and once again in violence. So in this section I have shown very quickly and superficially, some of the consequences and problems caused by money .
On a larger scale, money can also affect the lives of millions of people. Indeed all nations in the world aim at gaining power, and that is mainly achieved through money. This dream, or rather obsession of power of some leaders can give way to disasters. Indeed Saddam Hussein invaded Koweit for its strategic situation and gas resources. But that need also meant thousands of victims, and could have set off a new world war. And we all know that any war allows all atrocities we can imagine. Isn't this the ultimate expression, the mirror of evil?
In those two preceeding sections, I have dealt with some of the problems caused by ""money inequality"". But the biggest problem lies in the lack of money, in those people who don't have any money at all. In our society, we need money for anything: food, clothes, home, ... Without the basic necessities, people can get ill and even die. In the same way, a country without money cannot help feeding its population, which starves and dies as we witness in some African countries. Here again we find in misery and death the incarnation of evil .
So I think money is responsible for many of our problems, notably social ones. But we could hardly make it without money. Unfortunately it has lost much of its primary function as a trade exchange value and has gained too much social value .",Nevertheless I think money can claim being number one in that matter!,B2
314_MDCM2037.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Money is a tool of exchange, which can't exist unless there are goods produced and men to produce them. In the world we live in, one needs money in order to survive and be happy. Nowadays, it is impossible to live without money. Money is the key to getting most of what we need and want. People want money for various reasons, for surviving, for security, status, to be powerful etc. It is factual that money gives people power to succeed and to get what they want. However, sometimes excess power is used is a wrong way, which creates evil. In my opinion, money is not the root of all evil but human beings with their evil thoughts and actions, and in order to support my opinion I will elaborate on my ideas about how money affects society, how important it is and does it really make us happy.
	Firstly, it is clear that money is something very important. People need it in order to achieve their life's goals and supports, because most of the things in the world are related to money. People need money for their health care, because they can't resolve their health problems without money. They use money to buy food in order to provide nutrients to their body. People need money in order to study. For example, if a student has money, he or she can buy books, newspapers and computers to research and gain a lot of knowledge and information. So, if people have money they will feel more comfortable and confident to solve many difficult problems in their lives, especially in the areas of health, daily needs and education . 
	Secondly, money is not everything but it's something to make our life easier. But money has its own limitations too. Some might say that money makes them happy. But is it true? Because you use money in order to buy something but can you buy everything? We use money to buy material things which might make us happy. For example, someone might buy the phone of their dreams and be happy but is it true happiness? We can buy a lot of thing with money but we can't buy love, happiness, courage, discipline, manners, morals, trust and respect . [Quotation] says Catherine Sanderson, a psychology professor at Amherst College, [Quotation] . [Quotation] notes Dan Gilbert, a psychology professor at Harvard University and the author of the book Stumbling on Happiness. Money can give us power but also can make us selfish and lonely . 
	Thirdly, money itself it's not an evil, it is harmless. In fact evil comes from money users, that are we, human beings. Money is labelled ""an evil"" because of our thoughts and actions. Because of money a lot of crimes occur as robbery, theft, burglary. People are willing to commit crimes because of their greed. They desire wealth, status and power. Greed is one of the seven deadly sins and people do many evil things in order to get rich. The Apostle Paul, in his first letter to his young disciple, Timothy, had this to say: [Quotation] [Reference] . This verse is often misquoted as saying ""Money is the root of evil"" but it's not money itself the root of all kinds of evil but ""the love of money"" which is greed. Wealth is morally neutral, there is nothing wrong with money, or the possession of money. However, when money begins to control us that's when trouble starts . 
	To conclude with, I think evil is not caused by money. Money looks like an evil because it is used by ""evil"" people to accomplish their ""evil"" plans. People themselves are considered as the root of all evil and money is only a ""victim"". It doesn't mean that all people are evil, I believe in humanity, that everyone is born pure and good. However, evilness is present and it is up to us, humans, to decide whether we will choose to use money for good purposes or let the money use us for the evil ones .","Wealth is morally neutral, there is nothing wrong with money, or the possession of money.",B2
403_RUMO8004.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"I beleive this statement is completely untrue. Feminists have done a lot to the cause of women. Indeed there have always been organisations of women compaigning to promote women's interests in society .
Feminists concentrated on gaining access for women to education, employment and political interests. Feminism is concerned with ending legal discrimination against women and removing all barriers which prevent their entry into the public spheres on equal terms with men. During last four decades of the nineteenth century a series of campaigns emerged to improve women's legal and economic position .
Feminists have pressed for public policies to outlaw discrimination against women - both direct discrimination such as paying a woman less than a man doing the same job and indirect discrimination such as attaching unnecessary conditions to a job which will have the effect of excluding a woman. Feminists try to gain access for women to the rights , activities and responsibilities commonly available to men and to be ""let in"" to full participation in all areas of society as it currently exists .
Prevailing cultural norm used to require women to subordinate their active and creative needs to conform to a housewife role . As a result , stay-at home women felt empty and dissatisfied , tired and depressed .
There used to be sexual division of labour in the home , which designated the male as a breadwinner and his wife as economically dependent on him and responsible only for child care and housework .
This role left them fill rather isolated and low status. Moreover , women's dependent economic status gave men full control over the allocation of money within the home , and this often resulted in women not receiving the necessary benefits of men's wages. Such situation could spoil the relations within the family completely .
But now , because of women's movement, the situation has changed .
The employment of women, their ability to get a higher paid jobs affects the power structure of the family. A woman is no longer dominated by man , dependent on him , since their recources are equalized. Thus , a working wife's husband listens to her more , and she listens to herself more. She expresses herself and has more opinions. Instead of looking up into her husband's eyes and worshipping him ( what can make him a complete tyran ) , she levels with him , what makes him respect her. That doesn't certainly mean that a woman necessarily must devote her whole life to career - on the contrary , many feminists glorified her role as a mother. She just must have an opportunity to do both - her career and her housework. And I think , women's position in the public spheres of work and politics can not be viewed in isolation from their role in private sphere of home and family .
Still I beleive feminists must continue their struggle. There are still areas of professional work where women are grossly underrepresented .
Economic growth have improved women's material position , but many still experience poverty and their standard of living tends to be lower on average than men's - so , the goal of financial independence for women is not completely won. The questions arise naturally : Why women play such comparatively a small role in politics ? Why are low paid workers predominently women and high-paid professionals and managers mainly men ? So, as we can see , men as a group still gain a privileged position in society .
I also beleive that the political emergence of women acting consciously against domination by men is not just activiation of a new interest group. It's a historical event which holds the promise of enabling a more complete challenge of domination than has ever been possible before. Feminists' campaign have a long-term goal of transforming all relationships of domination and subordination in society .","Moreover , women's dependent economic status gave men full control over the allocation of money within the home , and this often resulted in women not receiving the necessary benefits of men's wages.",B2
124_FIJY1055.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Money is definitely the root of all evil. I believe that at least 96 % of all the people in the world are not satisfied with the amount of money that they possess. And because earning more money by honest work is too slow and the amount of money you get that way is too small, more and more people resort to dishonest action. But this is only one half of the story, for not only does the yearning for more money cause much physical harm, it also brings along great emotional pain .
Perhaps the most harmful thing about money is the fact that you can never have it enough. No matter how rich you already are, you will always want more, always. You can never just relax and enjoy your money. How sad and torturing it is to live your whole life always trying to reach the state where you no more have to worry about money, but never reaching it .
If you happen to be rich, you probably have one worry more than the poor ones; in the matter of friendship. How can you tell, who is your real friend and who is just some greedy slimeball after your money. As those slimeballs are usually excellent ""actors"", the only way to reveal their true colours would be to loose all your money. But because that is out of the question, you are stuck with uncertainty. So there is no one around you, who you could, without any doubt, trust .
The lust for money may in some cases also lead to passion for gambling. Las Vegas is the well-known paradise for gamblers all over the world. Many people have lost fortunes there, by the roulette tables. Some people even become addicted to gambling. They simply cannot stop gambling, even though they are up to their ears in debt because of it .
What about the drug business then. The drug lords have realized that you can get huge, gigantic profit in the drug business. And when the stakes are this high, all actions, including brutal murders, are ""justified"". The most horrible thing is that even some small kids are involved in this business. They are the best possible drug dealers, because no one usually suspects them, and because they cannot be arrested and imprisoned in case they get caught .
Too much money is definitely a bad thing especially for the young. They will never learn to work hard for something they want, if they can always get everything they want with money. For you can even ""buy"" someone to do your homework and your tests with enough money. This in turn can lead the young one to assume that everything is for sale, even friendship and love .
In some countries, even some policemen and judges are corrupted. With a few, carefully selected bribes, you can buy yourself out of trouble. So, money can even get in the way of justice .

308_MDCM2022.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Nowadays money is a powerful ""tool"" used by people all over the world. Since forever, the lust for power and money overpowers people and makes them do things they never though they would do. However, money itself does not posses any evil characteristic, but people's inability to control their greediness does. People are given a chance to choose what they will do with their money, and they can use it to help the people in need or fund a research.
	First of all, money can be used to help people who need it most. We constantly hear ""cries for help"" by people who were hit by an earthquake, tsunami or other natural catastrophe. In such instances people collect money and goods that will be used to help the people in need to re-build their houses, or repair the damage that has been done on their property. Additionally, there are many charities that help orphans, people who battle cancer, victims of domestic violence etc. These charities are funded by wealthy people, celebrities etc. whose money is used to help the people who desperately need it. It is commonly known that chemotherapy is an expensive treatment and unfortunately not all cancer patients can afford it. That is why the existence of such charities is vital for the survival of many people battling cancer. Another example of how money can be used for good causes is the donations/scholarships given to students with low income who are intellectually smart and want to continue their education . 
	Second of all, researches are very important when it comes to discovering new things, and are fundamental for the development of our world. Researchers are constantly working on projects, and very often these projects are funded by influential people with ""deep pockets"". Such cases are the donations made by Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt who donated to ""Global Action for Children"", ""Doctors without Borders"", ""Namibia Red Cross Action Program"" and plenty more.
	However, there are many people who blame money for people's inability to control their lust. Blinded by the power that comes along with money, they are ready to abandon their moral and ethical values. Those people believe that money can buy you everything, even happiness and love. But, if money bring the worst in people and make them lose their humanity, their ability for empathy and love, then why there are so many examples of people who used their money for good causes? That is why we cannot say that money itself is the problem, but it depends on the person, how they depict the world and how much control they have over themselves . 
	All in all, I believe that money itself is not causing harm, but people who are unable to control themselves and their greediness. Unfortunately, nowadays people are more and more interested in acquiring wealth, than the harm they are doing to themselves and the people around them.

394_RUMO5002.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"We have to face the fact that feminists have caused a lot of harm both to the society and the women's liberation movement, to the whole idea of women's liberation .
First and foremost, we should try to understand how it happened that men and women had found themselves ""on the two separate sides of the fence"". It seems to me that it is all due to feminists .
Feminists believe that they fight for equal opportunities with men. But what have they managed to achieve since they began fighting?
Men smile widely when they are asked to respect women's aspiration to have the same jobs and wages as they do. Because of the feminists' behaviour and their tricks men regard the idea of women's liberation as a very amusing one - and nothing more .
Men do not seem to think much of women's abilities. May be, that is because they see only funny nervous persons, who are not satisfied with the way they live, and these strange persons fight for women's rights. Many of those, who call themselves feminists are rude and fussy, and they do not have the slightest idea of real feminism, which is always ""pure and never simple"". But what we see now, is just a simplification of feminism .
Let's look into the matter of the feminists' ""achievements"" now .
Women all over the world can get any job - if they work hard .
It is not true in all the cases, but in many cases it is true. But if a woman managed to get a good job it is very often due to a man, who has hired her, helped her and who has let her dreams come true, because men are not as cruel and stupid as feminists consider them to be. And what is more, men are always glad to let women be equal to them as far as the question who will pay a bill in a restaurant is concerned. There are the cases when men spoiled by feminists, invite women to a restaurant, eat and disappear in order to give women a chance to be equal with them. Men who give seats to women in a bus died out like dinosaurs. They even are afraid of looking ridiculous and their motto is ""To die, but not to give up"". This is all fruit of many years labour of feminists. Who could imagine such situations a century ago, when there were not so many people involved into the movement! But I would like to return to feminists' ""achievements"". As we all know now, feminists hate compliments and hate people paying them compliments. And now we are told pleasant things more and more seldom . ""Haven't you noticed any thing? I have had my hair cut! - Oh, do not worry, your hair will grow again soon"". Such conversations have become part and parcel of our associating with men. But they adore to give us some pieces of advice, like: ""You'd better go in for sports - I don't want you to put on weight"", etc. I can't tell anything about feminists, but I believe, many ordinary women prefer being payed compliments - and they are fed up of such advice .
Men consider women to be equal with them but not in the cases we would like them to do. Men who have listened to feminists' speeches on TV, on the radio for a long time cannot treat women like princesses, but only like good chaps .
And another important point is to be made: those women, who really want to be equal with men don't speak about it too much and never make so much fuss about it, because they just do not have enough time. They abandon themselves to work and do their best to work as men do and even better, to achieve the results the men achieve. And they do not attract others' attention by their strange actions. That is all because they know: who but feminists assured men of their being stronger than women, although feminists wanted to do the reverse. It were feminists to build this fence between men and women by talking about it all the time .","But I would like to return to feminists' ""achievements"".",B2
011_BGSU1143.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"I agree to a great extent with this statement and, especially with the part preceding the comma. I can talk, of course, out of personal experience most objectively but I think I can express as well the feelings of many students from other fields. These are people I have talked to about this partucular subject thus I have gathered their opinion .
Just before coming back home I met a friend of mine who after hearing I had to write this essay offered his assistance by giving me some ideas. He is a ""freshly-cut"" graduate from the University of Architecture in Sofia. What he said was that the topic of my essay was very precise in its determining the problem of their education. They studied piles of most probably useless information and data but did very little on the practical level. They did not attend the actual planning of a new building, park, stadium etc .
Another major problem this friend pointed out was the lack of updating students with the technological progress in the particular field of study or work. He says that now that he has graduated he has taken up a course in computers. At university, instead of using ready-made packets of computer programmes especially devised for the utilization of the architect's work, they studied programming which once again is obviously useless. Nobody is giong to create his own programme .
In the field of ceramics, for example, the problems are serious. The students' time is occupied by theoretical courses such as technology of clay, perspective, aesthetics, etc. but nobody teaches the students how to use the pottery wheel and how to whet on it. They are not taught either how to draw the different types of patterns that decorate the dishes .
In our department problems are similar. Instead of having as many contacts with native speakers as possible we take theoretical courses in syntax, semantics, morphology etc. We don't know how to use the vast number of English teaching computer programmes. We don't use any TV or VCR equipment to aid our education. To make the course more practical we could also increase the number of translation classes .
To sum up then problems seem to be quite the same in the different field of the higher education. To make the study more useful a balance should be reached where we are given just the necessary and important theory, thus leaving space and time for practical courses which prepare us for the actual face of the profession that we are to be confronted with in our ""working future"".",We don't know how to use the vast number of English teaching computer programmes.,B2
050_CNUK1138.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"For many years, capital punishment has been discussed whether it should be abolished. My answer is certainly ""No"". Murderers are cruel. And they are usually referred to the violent thugs. They should be sentenced to death. What they put them do put them beyond the pale of humanity. They are not humans and, therefore, they cannot expect to be treated as human beings. They must be made to see the error of their ways, and the only way of doing that is the capital punishment .
Murderers whose motive is money should not get off lightly. The professional killer who would not think twice about using his cosh or crowbar to attack and batter some harmless lady to death in order to rob her meager life-savings. It is absolutely wrong to think professional killer are insane and need hospital treatment, The only thing that is the most suitable to treat him is to punish him the same as the pitying old lady was suffered. Maybe it is too cruel, but it is quite necessary. Criminals must be made to see the consequences of their crimes . ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"" is the very basis of justice .
Capital punishment used to be a major deterrent. It made the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger. It gave the cold-blooded poisoner something to ponder about while he was shaking up or serving his arsenic cocktail. It protected the most vulnerable members of society, young children, from sex-maniacs. It is horrifying to think that the criminal can literally get away with murder. Therefore, we cannot abolish this punishment, 
Of course some people claim that it is ruthless to punish the murderers by the cosh or hanging. But had the thugs had thought that it was too heartless to the innocent people before they committed the evils. It is not the proper thing they need to worry about. Executing by shooting, hanging or injecting the poison are more humane than the other penalties at present imposed. Thanks to the modem methods the capital punishment is quick and painless. It is only the agitators who campaign against the death penalty who say it is cruel. The reality is that it is a kindness to the murderers. Far better to be shot or hanged than to suffer the slow torture of life imprisonment which is in any case a burden on the long-suffering tax payer.. it is also inevitable that some people are always willing to hold liberal views at the expense of others. It is always fashionable to pose as the defender of the under-dog. So long as you, personally, remain unaffected .
We all know that ""life sentence"" does not mean what it says. It is only a nominal sentence. It leaves a chance for the criminal to escape. After ten years or so of ""good conduct"" the most desperate villain is free to return to society where he will live very comfortably, on the proceeds of his crime, or he will go on committing offences until he is caught again. In no time at all, the murderer will be released. How can ordinary people feel safe knowing that there are murderers on the prowl and probably seeking their next victim? 
Only the capital punishment can ensure that people can sleep safely in their beds. So, there should never be suspension of capital punishment .","We all know that ""life sentence"" does not mean what it says.",B2
033_BRSM1348.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"When the word feminism appeared, people experienced a different reality - considering the fact it happened during the nineteenth century in the United Kingdom and the United States. The consequences of the movements which have taken place back at that time have really caused changes and what we currently have is actually a completely different world, but the question is: has it changed for the best? 
In fact, for a long period of time mens and women's roles were very well defined and now people are going through a huge role change. Even though this change is not as global as it could be, its worldwide influence can be easily observed. In Japan, the group (wether a family or a society as a whole) is greater than the individual and this means a particular woman must follow the old rules based on Confucianism and Buddhism both combined with the military class, which is basically look upon her husband as if he were heaven itself. On the other hand, in South Africa, divorced men claim maintenance payments for their children from their former wives . 
Feminism is concerned with gender difference, and its discourse aims at equal rights. In a general way, when it comes to the Western society, it is possible to say that feminists goals are gradually being achieved. It is soon to say if the consequences of the theoretical equality of genders is good or bad for the society, but the reactions that happened so far show that this is a controversial subject. Before the revolution, it was easy to define mens and women's responsibilities men were the hunters, gatherers and providers and women, as the care-givers, took care of the children, of the house and, of course, of the husband. Today there are fathers in charge of the housework and mothers providing the financial sources . 
It is important to consider that both women and men can benefit from taking on more than one single traditional social role, and that there is quite a bit of research to prove it they show that multiple roles can be beneficial. The researchers have found that employment was associated with health improvement for both single and married women who had positive attitudes towards their jobs. Likewise, men who held multiple roles also had better health researches have shown that multiple roles do improve physical and phychological health . 
However, a routine that includes work, home, children and husband doesn't seem to be that easy. The studies and theories about the subject don't really mention the quality and the results a life with multiple roles has. Children education is another controversial issue and the problem with it starts at home. If a child doesn't have available parents, bad consequences will come, sooner or later. And if you don't have enough time to dedicate to your job and to focus on your career because you are taking care of your children, how far will you be able to go professionally? If you work too much and, when you are not working you are taking care of your children, how will you be able to keep a good relationship with your husband? Then, you have a mutiple role life - but with what kind of results? After all, are you really equal to men? And the most important thing: By living the supposed equal life, will you have time to actually live?",The researchers have found that employment was associated with health improvement for both single and married women who had positive attitudes towards their jobs.,B2

Money is envy, crime. Money is death... So, money is everything. All we have we have for money. If we have money we have everything. But should we have everything? That is the question. The more we have the more we want to have .
Do you want to be rich? - Yes, you do. If you said ' ' no ' ' I just wouldn't believe you .
And even if you said to your wife that you don't want to make a fortune your wife would kill you , I assure you. And what do you do to get some money? I'd like to quote a few words from a song: "" I work all night I work all day To pay the bills I have to pay - Isn't it sad?
And still there never seems to be A single penny left for me - That's too bad! ""
Don't you feel the same? You get up before darn and your working day has already begun. You spend the whole day working until absolutely worn out to go out anywhere or to enjoy your family life you fall asleep in an arm chare before your TV set. So you work from dawn till night day after day, week after week and so on , so forth. But what for?
A man's wife watches TV admiring the beautiful life shown in films. And she demands that her husband should work less , pay more attention to her and his children and still he should bring more money. Then he begins to understand that his life is unbearable. His life becomes a torture and... he commits suicide .
But let's talk more seriously. Money is the root of all evil. Do you remember the war in Chechnya? How many people died during that war! A great number of young innocent men, women, children were victims in the hands of our government. The leaders of our country made a pile by sacrificing their own people. And you know that most of the wars broke out because someone wanted to conquer new territories, nations and become the greatest in the word .
Vanity, the wish to have power, money, push a man to destroy the life of other people. For example lets speak about drug tradesmen. They make people their slaves .
For a grate sum of money a man allows himself to induce another person to lead a pitiable existence, to turn the other's life to dreadful torture. And what about drug addicts? They feel drug-made delight, pleasure, joyfulness for a few hours and they go to rob or even kill innocent people to get some money which they will pay for rotten drugs in order to forget the cruel world in their false dreams .
People steal information from each other. Then they sell it. And it doesn't matter to them why others buy that information and what they are going to do with it .
A lot of our sportsmen emigrated to the countries where they could make more money. They sell themselves, they sell their motherland. Isn't it sad?
We are the slaves of money. Even if we had fair money and we could enjoy them Could be proud of them, could we be happy knowing that other people suffer?
Money is the root of all evil. But we have no power to change it. People are too imperfect to live without money. We live for ourselves. It's against our nature. Do you remember the dream about socialism where all people are equal? To build that world was a great mistake for us .
Our vanity push us to struggle for a place under the sun. But isn't it the law of nature?
Don't animals struggle for their life? Of course animals have no money. But people are more complicated creatures than animals. So we invent end money. Animals struggle for their life without money and people struggle with the help of them .
So, what is money? Is it the way of our existence? Money seems to be the root of our rotten life full of cruelty and evil. But history knows the examples or it's better to say attempts of building society without money. They were all a crash. Then maybe the root of all evil is human nature, not money?",The leaders of our country made a pile by sacrificing their own people.,B2
476_TRCU1138.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"For centuries, capital punishment has been performed all over the world in order to punish criminals. Capital punishment is a legal infliction of death as a penalty. In fact, the death penalty is the most controversial penal practice in the modern world . Whereas some of them object to this punishment, some support it. The some death penalty methods mainly used today are hanging , the electric chair, firing squad, the gas chamber, lethal injection, guillotine and stoning. For some people, capital punishment is necessary, because it is a way to provide peace in society. Unlike them, many people against to this cruel form of punishment because of several reasons .
First of all, everyone has the right to live and everyone should respect to this fact. There are many people around and they have different characters and behaviours. Although it is natural and necessary to punish the illegal behaviours for peace of society, nobody deserves to kill because of his/her behaviours. The punishment of murder shouldn't be killing, for example. It is not right the extermination of human beings in the name of justice. The government should find another way instead of death penalty such as sentencing someone in prison. Life is a present to us from God and only God should take it away from us .
Secondly, the methods of capital punishment are so cruel and they are not accepted as humane. In 1977 Oklahoma became the first U. S. state to authorize execution by lethal injection. Lethal injection is when a lethal gas is place into the convict strapped down to the table. In addition, there is recent news; a woman who has been punished by stoning in Iran, because she has a baby without getting married. This kind of penalty is cruel and inhumane and also it is contrary to Islam. Furthermore, if you watch ""Green Mile"" on cinema, you can see its brutality. There is a man punished by death penalty and he is strapped into electric chair and electric current is passed through his body. It is really inhumane .
Finally, there is a question comes to our minds. Is capital punishment really effective? Does this death penalty really prevent the crime in society? In fact, it doesn't work because the rate of crime is increasing day by day. Death penalty is not a prevention for criminals. For many criminals, being killed is better than sentencing the rest of their lives in prison .
As a conclusion, people who commit crime should certainly be punished in order to prevent crime in society and it is also necessary for peace of society. But capital punishment is not an acceptable because of the reasons written above. Meanly, Everyone deserves to live and nobody, including government, decides on someone's life. Capital punishment does not really prevent the crime. It is the another reason of opponents of capital punishment. Finally, because the death penalty is a cruel form of punishment, it should be abolished in the world. Today 80 notions have abolished the death penalty and they use imprisonment instead of it .",The government should find another way instead of death penalty such as sentencing someone in prison.,B2
201_HUEL4109.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In our high-tech society mobile devices have achieved a great importance. Lately wireless phones have become ivailable parts of our daily routine. We usually feel lost without a phone at hand: we do not know the birthdays of our parents, we cannot recall our business appointment or we cannot contact our friends. Mobiles supervise, control and register each minute of our lives, we suffer from mobile-addiction. Therefore, suggest that mobile phones should be banned.
Firstly, the use of mobiles should be forbidden so that we could regain the sacredness of the private life. If we take a bus or we just walk along the Danube, we are forced to over hear other people's problems and details of their private lives. Mobile users do not seem to respect privacy of other people and that of their own. Furthermore, we are burdened not only with their intimacy but we should be always afraid that someone will call us and we will be in the same impolite situation. A mobile phone can ring at anytime and any where, thus we cannot feel safe and secure as it can break any harmonious moment of our lives.
Secondly, the ban of mobile phones would reduce the number of accidents. Car drivers will not turn off their mobiles when sit in their cars. Statistics, however, show that a large number of accidents is due to the use of mobile phones in the course of car-driving. Communication via mobile phone usually takes away the driver's attention that results in serious accidents. Therefore, we could conclude that if there is no mobile, there will be no accident.
Thirdly, many people say that mobile phones have become the symbols of the social status. The latest model of the equipment you have, the highest social position you are considered to be in. Therefore, many people spend a fortune in order to obtain the most recent mobile phone and keep up with the fashion world. Unfortunately, this process has appeared among young children, too. More and more parents are forced to buy mobile phones for their children, though they could not afford them. Mobile has become one of the gadgets that we should buy according to market-manipulating mobile producing companies, though we could easily live without it.
Many people say that mobiles rather ease than suppress or lives as these devices can prove to be useful when we lack time it is true that mobiles have advantages when we are in hurry, but we would not be hurry if we did not have mobile devices. In my opinion these wireless equipment are the cause of the acceleration of our world. We cannot slow down until we employ them.
To sum up, we can conclude that mobile phones destroy the privacy and intimacy of our lives. We are in constant stress whether our mobile phones will ring or not. Furthermore, statistics show that the use of mobiles increases the number of accidents on the roads. Finally, mobiles have become fashion devices and people spend much money to buy a new model. All these disadvantages of mobile phones, in spite of their advantages, suggest that mobiles should be banned from everyday life.","If we take a bus or we just walk along the Danube, we are forced to over hear other people's problems and details of their private lives.",B2

From the very beginning up to the end this time represents a great progress of mankind in all fields. It is literally overwhelmed by discoveries, historical events that are really worth putting down in history. In fact all the preceding centuries' contribution in the development of man power is incomparably less than the one made during this particular period. There is no need to enumerate a great number of names of people who made it possible to fly into space, to have such a good helper as a personal computer, to create real miracles in the fields of chemistry, biology and many other sciences .
So the 20-th century... It is not over yet but in my estimation in advance of time limits. As is known the time influences upon a man, changes him. Nowadays this dependence is especially actual and obvious because the tempo of industrialisation of life is too fast. It penetrates into the most spheres of modern society. But a man never can be a robot, though sometimes he has to come up to this invisible edge between a man and a machine, but it is too dangerous. The point is that his brain is an open system, ready to imbibe everything new. Moreover there are some fields which will always remain vitally important. For instance - human relations. When there is a lack of them, a man gets tired of life much faster, and when such facts take place he may simply destroy himself, commit a SUICIDE.
That's why everything concerning human nature needs directly is sacred and inviolable. People engaged in the sphere of entertainment and show-business have always taken it into consideration. A man is the only being enjoying soul. This abstract notion, the poets sang the praise of for ages, is naughty and hard to predict. Nevertheless it is the main feature differing a man from animals .
Let us try to follow the flight of human fantasy. All the modern inventions and achievements were born in this super computer called human mind. When the civilisation were in rudimentary state and later at the feudal time imagination was the screen reflecting all human thoughts. In the beginning all the great things were nothing more than dreams. Some of them a man made come true, some still wait for their realisation. That's why dreaming is a necessary step in all undertakings. It represents a model, maybe a very primitive one but still no less important. Also dreaming, is like a vent that helps us to escape reality for a while. Every man has his own dreamland ""but not everybody is eager to go a long way which begins in our mind. Only a rather lucky man manages to realise his ambitions, but ""God helps them who help themselves"". That's why strong will, and first of all, firm belief in our own dreamland is the key to survival in such a crazy world like ours .",Nowadays this dependence is especially actual and obvious because the tempo of industrialisation of life is too fast.,B2

In their opinion, the feminists have, among other things, changed the old consept of family. For instance, a result of the feminist movement in the 1970s, is more divorces. Women can get out of marriages if they have been treated badly by their husband .
The suffragette movement wich started in the late 19th century, resulted in womens' right to vote in the early 20th century. Feminist have managed to change the way society look at women and the way women view themselves. A woman's reputation was earlier the most preassus thing she had. After ""the sexual revolusion"" one have acknoledged that women have needs the same way as men does. Women throughout the western world have got new opportunities and possibilities. They choose higher education, which lead to economic independence and more freedom for women in general. A concrete result of feminism in the 1970s is women's right to have an abortion .
Young women today cannot identify with the term ""feminism"". Even though many women feel that still, there are areas in which men and women are not eqal, they will not be indentified with the ""un-feminin"", angry women that ""hated men"". I think that is where the feminists in the 70s were wrong. They had to many rules according to how women should look and act. Today, girls and women do not feel at home in that discription. They are individualists. They want to be respected in the same way men are respected; like individualists. That is why a new feminist movement arose in the late 90s. They call themselves ""the new-feminists"" or the ""Gucci-feminists. They feel that there are areas in wich they still have to fight. The issues are not as concrete as the ones that their mother-generation were fighting for. One example is domestic chores. Now that almost as many women as men have a job outside the home, women tend to be the ones who have to to all the work at home as well .
One negative effect of feminism which can be seen in this time, is the negative signals that espessially women give to other women if they choose to stay home, taking care of theur children instead of having a career. Women should be able to chose what they want to do without getting reactions that they are anti-feminsits .
In my opinion, feminism has not done much harm to women. The feminists have been radical in all decades and therefore thay have gotten a bad reputation. I believe though, that there has to be radicalism to create a norm. There are negative effects, but simply because there is still a long way before men and women are equal in all areas .

365_PAQI1001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Science is an organized body of knowledge concerning the physical world, both inanimate and animate. It is, in fact, a large collection of facts, arranged in the form of rules or laws. Scientists use exact methods to observe and study facts and natural phenomena, and do experiments to form laws of science. The sciences are branches of such knowledge and these are natural sciences like biology and geology and the physical sciences like physics and chemistry .
On the other hand, if a person is not exact in his expression and thought and uses his imagination to express much more than what he observes and feels, he may like to study and research in the arts or humanities .
Our is a scientific world. We depend on science in a great many ways. We know that science is necessary for the progress of any country. Scientists have made use of science for the benefit of man and society. They have used scientific principals, laws, and facts to invent and develop machines of different kinds. For example, the motor-car, aero plane and railway engines, printing machines, different kinds of machines used in factories producing things of daily use like match boxes, cloth paper, shoes and so on have been invented by scientists. The telephone, the calculator and computer are among the latest electronic inventions that have made our life modern and comfortable .
Scientists and doctors have invented and developed medicines that can cure speedily dangerous diseases like typhoid, cholera, and tuberculosis. Now human beings can live much longer than in older times. Even animals and birds get the finest medical treatment in modern hospitals where effective medicines and suitable facilities are all the time available .
Moreover information technology, as software industry, for operating the data programmes and systems of computer came to be widely used in the last twenty years . 
The technological advances of modern science have revolutionized our life patterns. The electronic industry, started in 20th century, has reached unimaginable heights of development. Science has transformed transportation magically, as now the supersonic jet can take man to the farthest end of the world in hours, and rocket can take him to the moon and even beyond. The fast moving submarines can pierce through the sea water under the surface to long distances with the help of radar, for the scientific and business purposes . 
In fact, science teaches us to work without prejudice. Scientists in all countries use the same formulas, laws and results. They should, therefore, work togather for the advancement of human kind .
So we can say that with all the progress in science, imaginations or dreaming cannot replace it. Because imagination is not based on facts and it also does not need any kind of rules or laws. It is totally based on free working of mind without any results. Imagination and dreaming is only useful in the world of arts and poetry because it is used to judge a poet . 
The power of imagination escap us from the real world and it brings human beings into a world far away from realities. There is no realistic approach in the world of fantacy and dreaming .

It seems to be the highest goal in most of the young people's lives. They do anything possible to become suitable applicants to a certain university. On the one hand the troubles they take are reasonable - after graduating you have more possibilities for a career; there are quite a lot of roads you can choose to walk along. You can even choose whether to walk or run. On the other hand, the things you study, especially here, in Bulgaria are so far away from reality that sometimes you forget what exactly your subject is .
Although it might sound too sophisticated, the University as an institution is a dream .
Before having the chance to be part of it your imagination makes it look like a dome. You fascinate about just teachers and friends; you dream of the hundreds tones of knowledge you are to get there but when the last thrill about you being a part of the Great Dome is gone, you feel as if you are on an entirely different planet. What is more - and entirely different HOSTILE planet .
Anyway, you suppose there is a kind of mistake... And you keep on hoping. Until one day you forget the subject you are studying. There are so many courses you have to take that there is no time left for the ones you like. You do not have time to read a single book, you do not have time to do your homework... But who cares! You have chosen to be there and dropping out is out of the question. But you keep on struggling. You fight for the right to learn. I, myself was extremely excited last year, when I was a First year student; on the one hand I was totally ruined physically and psychologically by everything I had to do, on the other hand I was absolutely pleased with the things I learned. This year I am able to see that most of the courses we have to take are so far away from reality, from anything that could happen to us, that I start to get amazed .

These are rather simple questions to answer but they tend to become more complex when we think of fairness and equality in relation to punishments .
There are acts and violations of human rights that can not go unpunished. For instance, such an extreme crime as murder could not just be forgotten and the murderer left free. For the good of individual people criminals should be isolated from society if they can not behave according to common rules. But who is criminal? On what grounds do we judge that someone has broken the rules? According to dictionaries a criminal is someone who has committed an illegal action, that is broken the law society has legislated through government. The next question that comes up is how should we punish the criminals. And furthermore what would be the right punishment for each crime? Can we make generalisations or do we have to judge each case individually? Yes and no. Yes, we can say that certain crimes such as steeling or damaging someones property, where only material things are concerned, are minor crimes and the offenders can usually be punished according to the same pattern. No, in that sense that in more serious cases such as murder, where people are concerned, we need to think of the criminals as individuals with differences in behaviour, background, values and motives. We can not judge them all on grounds of one or two cases because that would be like saying we are all alike. In general the conclusion is that the punishment should be equivalent to the seriousness of the crime. So if a criminal has committed a murder he or she will have to get a more severe punishment than someone who has caused only material damage which can be compensated with money. At least according to Western values .
The next question we have to answer is what we want to show or prove by using punishments. The usual answer is that they have been invented to show that crime does not pay. Furthermore their purpose is to make us aware that certain things are not allowed in society and those who violate the rules will be punished. But they can also prevent crimes from happening because if we know enough of the circumstances under which a crime has been committed we learn to avoid those situations and more importantly solve them in a peaceful way. The function of punishment is also to show that crimes are not acceptable or that they can solve any problems. On the other hand the aim of punishments is to make the criminals obey the laws and show example to other's so that they will not follow the bad example and commit the same crime .
But what about the fairness question then? Let us consider a situation were a known athlete and an ordinary man both commit the same crime. Will they be punished in the same way and according to the same paragraph of law? Probably not. Since the jury consists of men and women, real people with opinions and prejudgements of things, they can not put their feelings aside and be objective knowing that the other accused is a celebrity of whom they have already formed an impression. On one hand our value system, background, upbringing all influence our decisions. On the other hand not even the legal system treats everyone the same. Those who have money are able to hire a high-paid lawyer who can perform better than those public defenders who have to struggle with overtime problems. This means that our equality in front of the law is dependent on our financial state. Furthermore there are also other factors that contribute to the inequality in the court of law. For instance if a particular case gets a lot of publicity the people concerned handling it, especially the judge, might be pressured into ruling according to public demands and in the same time neglecting individuals rights to fair trial. More importantly punishing someone should never cross the line of revenge because then it could never be applied fairly .
Thinking of the right punishment we should keep in mind that the criminals are also human beings and they should be given the chance to correct their errors and readjust into society if possible. Should not we be greatful even if one lost sheep could be reunited with the herd?",More importantly punishing someone should never cross the line of revenge because then it could never be applied fairly .,B2
197_HUEL4081.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The phenomenon of mobile phones has been around for decades. At first, we looked at them with aroused curiousity, now we see them whenever we look, and cannot imagine our life without them. Still, the question arises whether they make our life easier and more comfortable or whether they make us become nervous wrecks. Some argue for them, some against but, I believe, they are rather harmful than beneficial.
Firstly, it is not only our own mobile phone that can annoy us but also that of other people. Though some of the ringtones are enjoyable, many to them are so unpleasant that it is difficult to bear them. We have to endure them on trains, buses and trams no matter how loud or disturbing they are. And it is not only the ringtone that we have to tolerate but also the conversation that follows it. It was unbelievable for me. At least for a while, that certain people are completely uninterested in the fact that I am listening to their most intimate conversations.
Secondly, the harmful effects of mobile phones on our health are proved by scientists. Experts carried out several experiments and it came to light that mobile phones can cause cancer in several parts of the body. At the sae time, they have a bad effect on our psyche as, because of them, many people suffer from tension.
Thirdly, we should not forget about the effects of mobile phones on schools. There seem to be a mobile phone boom in the secondary but also in the elementary schools. Lessons are often disturbed by children taking photographs of their teacher or punching the buttons of their mobiles; even though they are not allowed to use mobile phones in the territory of the school. I must admit that this can be the teachers' fault if they are not strict enough. Still, I believe, this form of disruptive behaviour would not exist if there were no mobile phones.
Finally, the intimacy of family dinners seem to evaporate since the members of the family rather talk to their friends on their mobile phones that to each other. Also the sight of a father walking his son and making a phone conversation at the same time is familiar. Some claim that mobile phones are vital because they help us to keep in contact with our family members, but I really do not see it like that, the reason for this is that, on the one hand, it is quite expensive to call somebody on the phone who is abroad. On the other hand, people seem to forget the good old days when they had sent letters to each other. In my view, this is a serious mistake, as a letter is always more intimate, personal and longer than an sms.
All in all, I think, it can be concluded that mobile phones cause more strain and pain than happiness. They not only ruin family life but also make the work of teachers more difficult, ruin our health, an cause tension when used in public.","We have to endure them on trains, buses and trams no matter how loud or disturbing they are.",B2
006_BGSU1063.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"There are quite a few people who think that higher education is unnecessary and that there is no point in studying at university. With the technical schools and the gymnasiums being rather popular nowadays most students would consider it enough to complete high school and don't take the trouble to continue studying at a higher level. This phenomenon alone is quite eloquent and understandable too. And one doesn't have to search very hard to reach the conclusion that there are plenty of factors contributing to that unfavorable attitude that people in Bulgaria have towards university education .
Just take a stroll downtown to the marketplace and you'll find why so many people consider university studying useless. There is hardly any person in the world who can convince me that one needs to graduate Nuclear Physics to sell cucumbers or to have a PHD in literature to deliver newspapers. However, if one goes to an average Bulgarian marketplace one is most likely to encounter qualified people doing low-paid unqualified work. I haven't seen any recent statistics but I'm sure that the number of people who work in the field they have specialized in is very low. What is the point then to study when you know you'll end up cleaning lavatories or washing dishes? Naturally these are jobs like any other but you don't normally study all that much to be able to perform them. And knowing that once you graduate you join the long gray queue of young unemployed people is hardly any stimulus for a young person to apply for university .
Unfortunately unemployment is a major threat not only to those who study theoretical matters but to graduates of the technical institutes too. People studying practical things such as engineering unable to find decent jobs is, I'm sure most people would agree, not the rightest of prospects. And thus most of these graduates become frustrated due to the lack of proper occupation and consequently much energy, talent and knowledge is wasted. Then one starts to wonder whether there's any point in studying at all. In the last few years, though, things have changed a bit. As the country shows some signs of improvement in terms of economics and political stability people start to see a light at the end of the tunnel .",There is hardly any person in the world who can convince me that one needs to graduate Nuclear Physics to sell cucumbers or to have a PHD in literature to deliver newspapers.,B2
082_DBAN1017.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The latest years it has become very difficult to find a job. It is often even moredifficult to find a job if you have a university degree than if you have a lower one. Is this because most university degrees are theoretical and therefore do not prepare students enough for the real world?
It is true that people who are for example a plumber or a technician do not need a university diploma and they can often find a job after they have finished their secondary school. These people are indeed trained to practise a certain profession and most of the time they have to do a work placement during their training .
People who have a university degree, on the other hand, have almost or no practise during their education, the only thing they have are a lot of books or courses they have to know by heart. Unfortunately, students at a university also do not do a work placement in their last year .
I think it is a pity that most university education do not have a work placement for their students in their last year, but if that really is not possible, I think the students themselves shoud have to prepare for the real world. There are several ways to do so .
In the first place, the students can prepare by acquiring knowledge about all kinds of things. During their student days, they should read a lot of books, newspapers and magazines. That way they learn a lot about politics, economics, culture and so on. The school can not learn you all these things, but you need to have a general knowledge if you want to become a part of the real world .
Secondly, the students should insert a work placement themselves. They can, for example, go studying at a university in another country for one year, take a course abroad for a month during the holidays or do a holiday job in a company. By doing a holiday job they learn what real life is all about, they get to know life in a company and moreover they earn some money .
In the third place, I think that students should not only learn their books and courses by heart because they have to know the material for the exams, but they should really try to see the importance of all the things they learn for later life. Unfortunately, some students keep studying only for the exams and do not see the importance of a general knowledge .
To conclude, I agree that university degrees are too theoretical and therefore they do not prepare students enough for the real world. But university degrees are not at all of little value if the students themselves complement their studies with some general knowledge, a course abroad or a vacation job. Besides, in my opinion, one of the characteristics of a university degree is that the people who have it are independent people, who are, with or without a lot of practical training, very ready for the real world .",It is true that people who are for example a plumber or a technician do not need a university diploma and they can often find a job after they have finished their secondary school.,B2
050_CNUK1138.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"For many years, capital punishment has been discussed whether it should be abolished. My answer is certainly ""No"". Murderers are cruel. And they are usually referred to the violent thugs. They should be sentenced to death. What they put them do put them beyond the pale of humanity. They are not humans and, therefore, they cannot expect to be treated as human beings. They must be made to see the error of their ways, and the only way of doing that is the capital punishment .
Murderers whose motive is money should not get off lightly. The professional killer who would not think twice about using his cosh or crowbar to attack and batter some harmless lady to death in order to rob her meager life-savings. It is absolutely wrong to think professional killer are insane and need hospital treatment, The only thing that is the most suitable to treat him is to punish him the same as the pitying old lady was suffered. Maybe it is too cruel, but it is quite necessary. Criminals must be made to see the consequences of their crimes . ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"" is the very basis of justice .
Capital punishment used to be a major deterrent. It made the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger. It gave the cold-blooded poisoner something to ponder about while he was shaking up or serving his arsenic cocktail. It protected the most vulnerable members of society, young children, from sex-maniacs. It is horrifying to think that the criminal can literally get away with murder. Therefore, we cannot abolish this punishment, 
Of course some people claim that it is ruthless to punish the murderers by the cosh or hanging. But had the thugs had thought that it was too heartless to the innocent people before they committed the evils. It is not the proper thing they need to worry about. Executing by shooting, hanging or injecting the poison are more humane than the other penalties at present imposed. Thanks to the modem methods the capital punishment is quick and painless. It is only the agitators who campaign against the death penalty who say it is cruel. The reality is that it is a kindness to the murderers. Far better to be shot or hanged than to suffer the slow torture of life imprisonment which is in any case a burden on the long-suffering tax payer.. it is also inevitable that some people are always willing to hold liberal views at the expense of others. It is always fashionable to pose as the defender of the under-dog. So long as you, personally, remain unaffected .
We all know that ""life sentence"" does not mean what it says. It is only a nominal sentence. It leaves a chance for the criminal to escape. After ten years or so of ""good conduct"" the most desperate villain is free to return to society where he will live very comfortably, on the proceeds of his crime, or he will go on committing offences until he is caught again. In no time at all, the murderer will be released. How can ordinary people feel safe knowing that there are murderers on the prowl and probably seeking their next victim? 
Only the capital punishment can ensure that people can sleep safely in their beds. So, there should never be suspension of capital punishment .",They should be sentenced to death.,B2

I agree with the title of the essay, that is to say, Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television. In fact, the influence of television on the * masses * is powerful and extraordinary. Television, * the opium of the modern masses *, has developped the public opinion, that is to say, the thoughts of civil society, which has, though the use of television, all the methods of information: films, soap operas, serials, television news, documentary films, and so on. People watching television are like * voyeur * who are deeply involved with the power of persuasion and conviction of Tv .
In the 20th century, television plays and has an important and decisive role on * the modern masses *, together with the development and expansion of technology and culture. The negative aspects of television became the object of study and analysis of authours such as Herman Marcuse for example. He underlined the negative power of television on the * modern masses *, such as the aspect of alienation, of the * manipulation * of the thought and behaviour of men. However that may be, television is and has been in the past, a powerful means and source of information, which contributes to the development of the cultural emancipation of men.

259_JPTF1019.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The number of countries which abolish the death penalty has been increasing. The United Nations General Assembly also adopted ""The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty"" in 1989 and published it in 1991. Contrary to these world movement, in most of America, China and Japan, the death penalty remains. By the opinion poll held in 1994, over 70% of Japanese people agreed to the death penalty .
Executions go unpublicized. Families of executed criminals Are notified only after the dead, so they can claim the bodies if they wish. The condemned person does not know when or if the execution will take place. I think this practice is both unusual and unnecessarily cruel .
But most of Japanese people don't know such cruel practice. Because the executions go unpublicized. The government has long claimed that executions are implemented in secret out of consideration for the feeling of the families, even of the condemned person themselves .
But I don't think that it's good for the families and condemned persons who prefer dying without being know? Most of man may want people around him to grieve when he die .
The practice that executions are implemented in secret is not for the families and the condemned persons themselves. More likely, the practice merely serves the interests of the state by suppressing public knowledge of this potentially contentious issue .
The lobby against the death penalty is weak in Japan. Under the present circumstances, it is difficult to tell in Japan or merely a logical consequence of the government induced secrecy surrounding capital punishment. The opinion that ""Out of sight, out of mind2 is not good .
But Mr, Nakamura Shozaburo said recently that the government was considering the announcement of execution in advance . ""We believe the public should know about executions that are carried out in accordance with court decisions,"" he told reporters. But he didn't say anything about notifying the prisoners themselves. It's a small opening, but it's very significant. Because it is the first time the government has considered modifying its policies on capital punishment .
Actually, the movement has been promoting. For example, the sentences seem to be reserved only for those convicted of the most heinous offenses. I hope such movement promote more and more .

The defendant was sentenced the death penalty. But he reflected after that and had written letters for the family for 3 years He apologized. The family, of course didn't forgive, but they demanded for the court to cancel the death penalty. But it didn't come true. And the executions went unpublicized .

As I do not like Karl Marx, I must say he was right in some cases and some parts of his ideology. For example his theory of socialism was very different from its later version presented and provided by Lenin or Stalin and their followers in many countries. I do not want to say that I would like to live in Marx's socialism. However it could be good and progressive in the middle of l9th century, today it is old - fashioned and step back. But strightly towards the main topic - television. Even when there are some similarities between the influence of the religion (by my oppinion more correctly the "" church "" as an institution) and television I do not think both things are something like opium. Surely, it can be used to manipulate with people as we could see on the examples of so called brainwashing sects last time in Switzerland and Canada in October l994 (as for religion) or on the example of state - controlled and censored televisions in totalitarian countries (as for television). But there are also many differences between religion and television. In the past, churches (of any religion) were very strong, centralized, effective organizations, systems that couyld achieve nearly everything they wanted to. What about television now ? Each television (TV station) is also very well organized system, but there are hundreds or thousands of such and all together they make an unbelievable mixture with nearly no common purpose or target (except earning money). And spectators can choose. I should say some of them are sometimes frustrated from their opportunity of choices. They do not know what to choose. There is noone to tell them what to choose or how to choose. Someone tries to catch everything and another one becomes to be depended on television. But not all. It is not problem of the masses. There are also a lot of people who are TV abstainers. The main problem of television I see in its influence on children and youth. There is no doubt that television works sometimes as opium. Some children are able to watch TV all the day. There are of course many educational programms and TV helps to improve knowledge, but on the other hand also damages imagination of children, their own activity, independent thinking and shows the world in the different way than it really is . (i. e. increasing number of programms showing violence or cruel scenes . ). Many children then do not know, they can not distinguish between reality and fiction, they think everything shown in TV is normal and it belongs to life . (To kill a man on the street just because he had coat colour I did not like, it is normal. TV heroes do that, don't they Mom ? ). Children watch television for many reasons: it is very funny, it entertains sometimes it isw adventurous and mainly it is very easy. Just push the button and sit or lay or what else. Many parents do not have enough time for their children and they often say: "" Oh, be quiet, be good, go and watch TV. "" Then television becomes to be the only thing that educates the child (if it is young, later of course thereis also school - but as I can say from my short practise - two years - of teaching at elementray school, during the school breaks children very often talk mainly about what was on Tv yesterday, what is today or which new film they have on video . ). Is there any chance to stop the evolution of Homo televisionis growing from younger and youger generations ? We know about some, some new things will have to be prepared and thought. We will have to pay more attention to the personal contact with the child during the process of education. More attention and cooperation from parents, teachers and other adults. We can not educate children just through TV screen or other machines. New methods of education should be invented, more involving programms for youth (I do not mean TV programms), another types of entertainment. And entertainment is the main thing that children demand. I am not sure we can solve the problem with ways we use today. It is similar to teh problem with opium or other drugs. Legalize it ? Abolish ? Reduce ? Fight against it ? No, something completely, completely new. There is a time for new Einstein or for new J. A. Comenius. Prague 22th November l994",Legalize it ?,B2
410_SEBG1032.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The question whether equality among people exists and to what extent, has occupied minds of thoughtful individuals for milleniums. Its definition, number of layers and the way it is perceived across different cultures all add up to the complexity of this theme. Shadding the light of present day capitalism (with all of its atributs) onto the matter, we might find different peculiarities there and make a number of conclusions .
I strongly believe, and there are many evidence in support of my belief, that Orwell was right: some people are indeed more equal than others. Firstly, the most common ""diferentia specifica"" nowadays among people is money. The more you have it, the more protected you are, in almost all possible ways. The question ""what's his/hers net worth"" has become so common in the States that it is not considered unusual let alone unethical or rude to ask it on your first or second date. My country is no exception. Being a member of certain political parties in Serbia entitles you to have access to different kinds of power: jobs, opportunities, money... In addition, gender (in)equality must be given special focus. Women work just as much as men do, but they earn approximately 1/3 less. Finally, as a member of minority group, I occasionally experience national and religious bigotry and ignorance. All mentioned above led me to believe that we live in a truly inequal world .
However, things are not all that black and white, and there surely are examples of equality. Studying English at this University has thaught me that equality does exist: it doesn't really matter to professors who you are, what do you wear and what is your social status, but rather you performance and knowledge. Furthermore, people are equal in pain, love, hate, grief... You can't possibly avoid any of them no matter what. The ultimate equality marker we also can't possibly avoid is death. In the words of famous Serbian poet Jovan Ducic, [Quotation] . 
To sum up, even though there are things that can lead us into believing that people are equal, it is imensely important to be able to tell the difference between equality in abstract things (we are all capable of by nature), and equality in real life terms. Infortunately, due to many causes, most of which are of economical and political nature, equality in real life will remain to be just another utopistic idea that individuals will spend time debating on .","Furthermore, people are equal in pain, love, hate, grief...",B2

As time past, technological improvement appeared, mainly from the 20th century, n order to be able to contact with our relations, friends or lovers more easily and quickly. The first of this kind was the telephone and prefebly the mobile phone. However, it has become a tool which unconsciously though, but makes us feel lonely in the most negative sense.
The meaning of the worked loneliness has altered in the last couple of decades. While in the past it meant the time of examining ourselves or fro some being artistic, in the present century the members of a community feel neglected if they cannot contact with somebody by using a technological device called mobile phone. The member of a family tend to priorities talking on the phone to talking to each other. Even the undisturbed family meals have disappeared. Adults and children lose everyday contact because of the phone's presence. They consider telecommunication more important than real private communication. Therefore, the members of the family become lonesome in the world!
In addition to feeling as an outcast in the family, a person can also be abandoned by his or her friends. People get accustomed to be able to call their friends any time in order to tell about every little events which happens. Nevertheless, if something un expected occurs it gives the feeling of ignorance and neglect. In the past it was a natural thing to not to hear from a friend for weeks. Friends wrote long letters to each other. However, friends are obliged to response immediately otherwise the receiver is left lonesome. This person cannot be blamed for this kind of emotion. Not receiving an answer certainly makes one ignored. It is the speed of this communication device which has to be accused of.
Lastly, there is the relationship with our partner which is also effected by the use of mobile phones. Most people would disagree with its negative effects. They consider that it is wonderful to contact with our lover anytime during the day. There is no doubt about its magic especially when a couple is still very much in love. On the other hand, as their relationship progresses it becomes a disturbing factor. Partners talking during the day lose their interest in the other person by the time they meet. If they discuss different issues, beforehand, on the phone there is nothing to talk about personally. It gives the impression of being left alone for ourselves. Moreover, if connection cannot be completed a person feels offended and abandoned. Being in love does not last as long as it did in the past. In old times a woman or a man could remain in love with somebody for even a lifetime. Nowadays, it is impossible. Lovers open to the other opposite sex in a year. as much as they did in ten years time in the past.

TV became an ordinary domestic appliance, which is purchased even by the poorest families. It might be even strange that some families have TV but they do not have a washing machine. Television already became a part of any apartment like electricity, heating and other services .
 Moreover, a little emphasis is put on the fact that people would not be able to watch various films on TV, without paying some additional taxes. That is any film or program is constantly interrupted by advertisements. The key is that lots of companies try to make people buy their products using TV advertisements. They are making money on advertising. The audience is almost hypnotized with endless row of attractive and colorful images. Finally, they are not able to avoid watching advertisements, because they are simply overpowered by the driving force of a film or discussion program. The images stuck in people's mind and when going to a supermarket they subconsciously choose the good as definitely the best .
 Eventually, television influences human's thoughts, attitude and even behavior. For example television presents various ideals to be followed. Women are constantly reminded that successful relationship with men is based on a beautiful thin body of a woman. So women are persuaded that they will manage to establish successful relationship only being fit and eating less. Children are fed up with images of self confident, clever and able to fight people. Men are given some information about political processes in the land. They do not think that a camera of a reporter might present information from different angles. Truth is often controversial. One could argue to death whether it is good or bad influence that television makes, but it is really obvious that people are controlled by television. A lot of people spend their leisure time in front of TV set. Children may watch cartoons endless hours. It is very often that people are not able to plan and control the time they are going to spend for this activity .
 To tell the truth, it was already accepted fact that cinema theatres were the only place both for poor and for rich, as well as for men and women where one could get rid of reality and daily problems. Various television companies were able to purchase expensive movies and to show them to people staying at home thanks to advertising industry. Movies, cartoons, discussion programs, concerts and other programs formed a great cluster of choices. Any representative of social, age or educational class could find the things he or she was interested in. Poor people were able to see the materialization of their dream of becoming rich. Disobeying, revolutionary ands restless teenagers saw their dream images of risking, witty, physically strong and attractive heroes. Ordinary housewives depressed by daily routine were able to see romantic men of their dreams .
 All in all, television became a tool of magic. People unconsciously became controlled by television. It seems they forgot that ordinary people create any television channel.

I can talk, of course, out of personal experience most objectively but I think I can express as well the feelings of many students from other fields. These are people I have talked to about this partucular subject thus I have gathered their opinion .
Just before coming back home I met a friend of mine who after hearing I had to write this essay offered his assistance by giving me some ideas. He is a ""freshly-cut"" graduate from the University of Architecture in Sofia. What he said was that the topic of my essay was very precise in its determining the problem of their education. They studied piles of most probably useless information and data but did very little on the practical level. They did not attend the actual planning of a new building, park, stadium etc .
Another major problem this friend pointed out was the lack of updating students with the technological progress in the particular field of study or work. He says that now that he has graduated he has taken up a course in computers. At university, instead of using ready-made packets of computer programmes especially devised for the utilization of the architect's work, they studied programming which once again is obviously useless. Nobody is giong to create his own programme .
In the field of ceramics, for example, the problems are serious. The students' time is occupied by theoretical courses such as technology of clay, perspective, aesthetics, etc. but nobody teaches the students how to use the pottery wheel and how to whet on it. They are not taught either how to draw the different types of patterns that decorate the dishes .
In our department problems are similar. Instead of having as many contacts with native speakers as possible we take theoretical courses in syntax, semantics, morphology etc. We don't know how to use the vast number of English teaching computer programmes. We don't use any TV or VCR equipment to aid our education. To make the course more practical we could also increase the number of translation classes .
To sum up then problems seem to be quite the same in the different field of the higher education. To make the study more useful a balance should be reached where we are given just the necessary and important theory, thus leaving space and time for practical courses which prepare us for the actual face of the profession that we are to be confronted with in our ""working future"".","They did not attend the actual planning of a new building, park, stadium etc .",B2

The twentieth century is inconceivable without television .
Almost every family in the world has a television set. There are TV sets in cafes and bars, schools and universities, in hospitals, banks and airports. Television is a universal source of information. People can study and travel with the help of television, it informs us of current affairs home and abroad and of course television is a good means of relaxation .
TV has become a new kind of art. Directors and cameramen have to work a lot to create a good show. Different special effects are used to make it more exciting and sometimes frightenning. But among hundreds of programmes only few are really popular with the vewers. Some showmen and newscasters are not inferior to singers and actors in their popularity .
I am not sure if it is possible to call television a new relegion but it goes without saying that millions of people adore it. Some of them do not only watch TV, they also come to TV studioes and take part in their favourite programmes and chat-shows, they want to talk to TV- stars and to get their autographs .
Besides television plays an important part in the popularization of sports. It gives sport fans an opportunity to watch different competitions and matches at home if they can not buy tickets or just have no time to go to a match they would like to see. Top models and popular sportswomen perform their shaping programmes on TV and women can work at their bodies together with them .
Plenty of soap operas are being shown on television now and most women , especially housewives enjoy them immensely. They try not to miss a single part, they discuss the troubles of the characters and take them close to heart.I think there are some funny and touching soap operas but in most cases they are boring because they are very often alike .
A large number of programmes are designed for children. Playgrounds usually become deserted when animated cartoons or other programmes for children are on. There are a lot of wonderful and touching ones and small boys and girls and even grown ups watch them with great pleasure .
Unfortunatelly in Russia television is usually the only amusement invalids and bed-ridden people can afford. They are the most regular viewers of TV programmes.I think it is an important merit of televisoin .
But of course television has its own drawbacks. It seems to me that there are too many programes devoted to politics. We should be informed of current affairs but in our country people have to face so many problems and they want to forget about them at least for a time. But it is impossible if every minute you are told about crimes and political problems .
I also think that too much violence is shown on the screen and there is violence even in cartoons for children. Some of them are about wars and fights and robberies. Meanwhile children watch many hours of television and it has great influence on them, besides children are inclined to imitate the characters they see on the screen and I would not like it if my younger sister became as cruel as some of them are .
People complain there are too many advertisments in between the programmes . Advitisihg campains bring in great profit to businessmen and I do not think angry viewers can help it. Anyhow there is something they can do about it-just turn their TV sets down not to hear primitive slogans .
I think television may be compared with religion and of course there is some resemblance. As any religion TV has its detractors and people who adore it and even fanatics. The former never turn their TV sets on if they have any while the latter watch TV night and day, try to persue TV and film stars, get nervous when advertisments last too long and know the TV - guide almost by heart.I am sure that both go to extremes .
To my mind television is just a kind of amusement ,a way of relaxation. It is an invention which gives us possibility to broaden our horizons makes our life more interesting. But it should not be opium or a religion which would let us escape from reality or have great influence on us. As far as believers are concerned I do not think television can substitute for their religion or church services.I am sure that neither TV nor computer and ""Internet"" or any other achievments of science and engineering are a good substitute for reading communicating, love or religion .",TV has become a new kind of art.,B2

The United Nations General Assembly also adopted ""The Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aiming at the abolition of the death penalty"" in 1989 and published it in 1991. Contrary to these world movement, in most of America, China and Japan, the death penalty remains. By the opinion poll held in 1994, over 70% of Japanese people agreed to the death penalty .
Executions go unpublicized. Families of executed criminals Are notified only after the dead, so they can claim the bodies if they wish. The condemned person does not know when or if the execution will take place. I think this practice is both unusual and unnecessarily cruel .
But most of Japanese people don't know such cruel practice. Because the executions go unpublicized. The government has long claimed that executions are implemented in secret out of consideration for the feeling of the families, even of the condemned person themselves .
But I don't think that it's good for the families and condemned persons who prefer dying without being know? Most of man may want people around him to grieve when he die .
The practice that executions are implemented in secret is not for the families and the condemned persons themselves. More likely, the practice merely serves the interests of the state by suppressing public knowledge of this potentially contentious issue .
The lobby against the death penalty is weak in Japan. Under the present circumstances, it is difficult to tell in Japan or merely a logical consequence of the government induced secrecy surrounding capital punishment. The opinion that ""Out of sight, out of mind2 is not good .
But Mr, Nakamura Shozaburo said recently that the government was considering the announcement of execution in advance . ""We believe the public should know about executions that are carried out in accordance with court decisions,"" he told reporters. But he didn't say anything about notifying the prisoners themselves. It's a small opening, but it's very significant. Because it is the first time the government has considered modifying its policies on capital punishment .
Actually, the movement has been promoting. For example, the sentences seem to be reserved only for those convicted of the most heinous offenses. I hope such movement promote more and more .
Oneday morning, I watched a certain TV program. The theme was the death penalty. And a man whose brother was kill appeared. His brother was insured and killed by the beneficiary. The defendant was sentenced the death penalty. But he reflected after that and had written letters for the family for 3 years He apologized. The family, of course didn't forgive, but they demanded for the court to cancel the death penalty. But it didn't come true. And the executions went unpublicized .
The performer said ""The criminal died, but my brother never revive. We are not healed at all. The death penalty only make sorrow.""
As he said, I think death penalty only make negative things. So I against the death penalty. Nobody has right to kill others. Even if it's government or court .",But most of Japanese people don't know such cruel practice.,B2

(Small boy's definition of certain TV programs).
It would be great hypocrisy on my part to start putting on airs and say that I never indulge in such lowbrow activity as watching TV. Oh, shame on me, I can watch it from dawn till night when I have a day off. I remember, as a child I used to contemplate on what a horrible life must our poor ancestors have led who had no television, poor dears!
There is no point in denying that TV has become part and parcel of our everyday life. It is a feature of our civilisation and when it has ceased to exist our life will change .
We must give television credit for its educational programs, for example, I find TV language lessons very helpful. Then, isn't it wonderful to travel around the world without stirring a finger; to visit places and see things that we are dying to visit and see, but have very little chance of ever doing it: we can witness a volcano erupting; we can go down under the sea and watch sharks and octopus and what not; we can have a look at our planet bird's eye view or even from the outer space. All this feeds our imagination and convinces us that things we find in books really do exist .
Such a phenomenon as mass culture would hardly have existed without television. There can be varied opinions about mass culture, but we should admit that, a cheap and vulgar substitute though it can be, it is better than nothing at all. The highbrow may be irritated by some programs, but for some they may be the only source of information: television expands their knowledge of the world and enriches their vocabulary .
Addictive as it is, television rules our lives: we plan everything in accordance with the TV schedule. Vulgar as it may be, television forms our world-view: we see only those things that we are shown; if TV-makers consider something to be uninteresting for the largest part of viewership or simply not spectacular enough, than we will never learn of its existence .
What I dislike about television is that it not only does not encourage ""ordinary folk"" to use their little grey cells, but even makes them believe that the rest of the world is populated by their like. As Nathalie Sarraute put it: ""Radio and television have succeeded in lifting the manufacture of banality out of the sphere of handicraft and placed it is that of a major industry"". Television gives us all, so to speak, a set of common words and thoughts that we all share, and then it gives us the impression that everything else is heresy .
The mind of an ordinary person nowadays is crammed with facts and opinions and viewpoints, and very often they contradict each other. One may call it a ""jig-saw puzzle"" world-view where lots of pieces simply do not fit in. Nevertheless, this creates an illusion of a deep insight into everything: people do not understand that to know something does not mean to store everything one hears about it, but to form one's own idea about it. Names of famous writers and composers have become household names, but that does not mean that people have become more educated .
May be we, all of us, are poor TV-addicts and waste our time ogling into the flickering screens that slowly but steadily sap our intelligence, but still it is great to know that this great comforter, enlightener and entertainer is always with us, ""for better for worse, in sickness and in health, till death us to part"".","So much chewing gum For the eyes .

248_JPSW3003.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Today English is widely used among many people in the world. The necessity of that people can use English is clearly rising. Now many students, adults, even little children are learning English at a school or special school like an English conversation school in Japan. But acquiring English in the native country is not easy. Some learners of English have difficulty in learning English before they reach proficient level. Then what are the most important factors in successful language learning? It's not intelligence and aptitude. Some individuals have an exceptional aptitude for language learning. But I think that the answer is motivation and attitude. High levels of motivation and positive attitude are correlated with success in language acquisition. And successful learning enhances motivation. I believe that .
The principal way that teachers can influence students' motivation is by making the classroom a supportive environment in which students are stimulated, engaged in activities which are appropriate to their age, interests, and English level. And most important thing is that students can experience success. So English teachers need to devise their classes to make interesting and effective classes so that their students can be interested in English and progress their English well .
How class is interesting and effective for students? It's a student-centered class. Some English teachers don't give their students many opportunities to speak in English. In English class, teacher should not be a center of the class and should give students many opportunities to use English as much as possible. And it's important for teachers to make a good atmosphere that all students can speak their opinions or thoughts freely .
When I was a high school student, all English teachers taught us in Japanese. They hardly spoke English except for reading textbook. And they applied traditional method like a grammar translation. The focus was on the language itself, rather than on information which is carried by the language. The teachers' goal was to see to it that students learned the vocabulary and grammatical rules of English. And the goal of students, including me, was to pass an entrance examination for university rather than to use English for daily communicative interaction. So I guess that most of the students couldn't speak English well .
I think that English teachers should teach in English. I, of course, want to teach in English. The English class in the high school (and junior high school) is only place where students can learn useful English. Many students go to a supplementary private school and study English but the taught things there are only grammar and the way to get good score in English examination or test. So English teachers in high school have to teach more practical English .
In many school, the most widely applied method is no doubt the grammar translation method. But this teaching method is inadequate for English acquisition. I think that teachers should many opportunities to engage in conversational interactions in group and paired activities. These activities will be able to lead to increased fluency and the ability to manage conversations in English .
I heard the news that new school where focuses English would be established in Kanto soon. In the school, other subjects will be taught in English. The number of such the school may increase in future. English teachers will need higher English skills to teach. I will study hard and contribute to students' English learning as an English teacher.","And the goal of students, including me, was to pass an entrance examination for university rather than to use English for daily communicative interaction.",B2

We have no time for dreaming and imagination. Science has made our life so easy. Science has provided us with so many pleasures and comforts. It reduce human sufferings and hardships.

We have reached at the bottom of the ocean and flown over the Everest. We have also reached on the moon. The crowning achievement of science is the release of atom energy . 
If we try to write about the benefits of science, we can easily run into pages. Every thing has its own advantages and disadvantages. If we look to the other side of the coin that inspite of all these comforts or luxuries the life is not happier .
Science has taught us to fly like birds and swim like fish but it has not taught us to act like men. It has made us cruel and inhuman. Self suicide attack has made a common thing now-a-days. We have killed at large number of people in a few seconds. Such cruel people have no feelings for others. The materialistic civilization has temporary glamour. Because it has the germs of destruction within itself It has no moral values which give permanence to civilization. Science, we use it, for both constructive and destructive purposes .

204_HUEL4136.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"That employees make long phone calls on their mobile phones discussing either their private lives or managing their usual everyday affairs is a well-known fact, unfortunately. These kind of phone calls disturb others while they are trying hard to concentrate on their work. This insufferable situation is due to the fact that no etiquette concerning the adequate and proportionate use of mobile phones has been established at workplaces yet. Therefore, every workplace, company and office should formulate a detailed eituette regarding the use of cellular phones so that employees would not make each other's work performance decline.
Most importantly, by establishing and applying a set of rules restricting the use of mobiles at workplaces the quality of work could be sustained and improved effectively. If there are no redundant mobile calls during work a greater adherence to work and the elimination of phases of milder concentration on the part of employees will both be achieved. This will result in a more successful business management.
In addition to the enhancement of business management, creating a mobile phone etiquette would also lead to ameliorated collegial relationships since everyone would have to take their peers' interests into consideration as well as regards the use of cellulars. Thus, heated debates on the topic would cease because everyone would obey the established rules. As a consequence, cooperation among colleagues would be fostered, and several new friendships may also develop.
It might be argued, however, that such a restricting etiquette is inherently confusing and disorienting since there are quite a few borderline situations at a workplace when it is almost impossible to decide whether responding to a particular call violates the etiquette. Moreover, in such situations one must make a decision within a few seconds, which might not be enough for estimating and anticipating the exact nature of a call, which then also needs to be compared to the points defined in the etiquette. While this is undoubtedly true, it ought to be realised that on the whole the advantages outweigh the mentioned disadvantages; after contemplating all the possible aspects of mobile phone rules, it seems reasonable to claim that in the case of properly defined guidelines employees and employers alike will surely face fewer disturbing or even embarrassing situations related to the improper use of cellular phones than in the case of entirely lacking such rules. The lack of a mobile etiquette would eventually lead to frustrations and a tense atmosphere at any workplace. Hence, mobile phone regulations should be applied at workplaces for the benefit of all the people working there.
In conclusion, it might be stated that a detailed set of rules concerning the use of cellular phones needs to be defined at every workplace since it is the only way to guarantee the high standard and the quality of work. Not only will such rules help to preserve high quality work performance but they will also improve collegial relationships and the atmosphere of the workplace.","As a consequence, cooperation among colleagues would be fostered, and several new friendships may also develop.",B2
099_DBAN3065.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Some people believe that university education is theoretical and therefore does not prepare students for the real world. In their view, the only knowledge universities give you is bookish knowledge, which you can hardly use in your future post. Hardly any attention is paid to the practical side of the education .
To a certain extent I agree with this-conviction. How many times do you find a company offering a job in an ad that doesn't ask for someone ' with experience's Not very often, I'm afraid. The reason why companies strongly insist on experienced people is probably that they have had bad experiences with newly graduated employees. I can easily imagine that companies prefer people with a lot of practical knowledge in their pockets. But where ever are students supposed to get those practical skills? In my opinion, university education is remiss in this respect .
To make these statements more concrete and to the point, I'll confine myself to philological trainings, like Germanic languages. Graduate teachers are not prepared for the hard world of education. They don't know how to quiet down a shouting and unruly class or which teaching method to use in order to get the best results. In short, they are not able to cope with certain practical problems. For no one has ever familiarized them with the practical side of the teaching job .
Too many people think that a teacher's task is to walk into the classroom, give his lesson and leave the classroom again. But there is so much more to it than meets the eye! If there is no order in the classroom, it's really not easy to teach. In view of such a situation, I think that a course in pedagogics would be of use to any teacher-to-be, for teaching also involves ' upbringing'. A teacher helps a young person to grow into a balanced and independent adult .
But not only students of philology who want a future in education need practical skills. Those who go for journalism or economics could use these skills as well. Most graduates of philology have never studied any economics in their whole lives, whereas they really should have a notion of it if they want to work in a company .
Seeing that students of philology go different ways after their education, I suggest the following adjustments of the university educational system. During the last year of any philological training, optional courses should be provided in education, journalism, economics, ... . Each student should decide for himself what his future plans are and select a course in accordance with those plans. Pedagogics, business economics, social skills, statistics and technical jargon should be some of the optional courses. In my view, it's extremely important that those courses should focus on practice. They should enable students to put their bookish theory into practice and to specialize in those things they will really need in their future jobs .
That way, university degrees will stand for high theoretical ànd practical knowledge .
Apparently universities are willing to do something about it. They want to introduce an extra teacher training year after philological trainings. But unfortunately the Minister of Education Luc Van den Bossche doesn't agree to this proposal. He is prepared to contribute his mite though, by offering the universities extra subsidy. It's a step in the right direction, but there is more to be done .
Comparing a university education with a secondary teacher training, lower level, you'll see a world of difference. Yet, students from university as well as from teachers' training college end up in the same boat when they choose for education! The difference: secondary teachers lower level are competent at writing on the blackboard, oral expression, preparing a lesson, ... . Moreover, they know everything about the educational system, which can't be said about university students .
In fine, universities could learn a lot from teachers' training colleges as far as the practical aspect is concerned. I think it would be a good thing to bring about a mixture of both types. As a consequence, some university studies might last a year longer, but that's the price we'll have to pay for a university degree with real value!","Comparing a university education with a secondary teacher training, lower level, you'll see a world of difference.",B2

Really? Is it really still true? I remember a sci-fi story which I've read several years ago. A lonely woman, operator, by chance got acqainted with a man by phone. Their phone-calls became more frequent and the woman thought that she had finally fond someone, she would like to stay with, someone who understands her and accepts her. What was strange was that the man always avoided meeting her and he didn't even want what he looked like. The curiousity and the desire to see her beloved made the woman search for his phone number. What a shock it was to find out that her friend was a computer!
The present science and technology have accomplished so incredible things that we could even hardly dream about several years ago. Scientists experiment with so delacate materials as the genetic information and brain cells are. Don't they fear that once they'll reach the top, they'll have created a perfect robot which will be not just a perfect copy of human body but also a copy of human feellings and ideas?
Some people say that in our modern warld there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But on the other hand there is exactly the same number of people who thing just the opposite. They realize very well the danger which goes along with the technical progress. They try to draw our attention to it and fight against it with their own means .
Arts have always been a way of a balance and resistance to modern world. Artists have been expressing their opinions towards science and technology. Apart from a few euforic periods when they glorified them they usually warn against them. Take Jules Verne as an example. How many of his utopic visions have come true! Certainly many sci-fi writers could have become the prophets of modern era .
Remember how many poets wrote ethusiastic poems about technical civilizations. And what conclusions did they arrived at in the end of their work? They usually glorified the nature and natural life of people far away from the technical world .
Why are present people becoming more and more interested in ancient myths, philosophy and religoin of the Orient? Perhaps it's the archetypal need of man to whom modern science failed to answer the most crucial question of human existence, the need return to the very beginnings when the white was white and the black was black .
Look at the present film production. What makes a commercial film successfull? The story which is put into an interesting setting somewhere in the Universe, exotic country, ancient history or unexisted world of fairy-tales, shortly in the environment which we can hardly know and which incites our imagination, But this presentation and imposition of some topics could be risky because the choice of topics for dreaming is limited. If kids are attacked by dinosaurus, turtles and Barbies from all directions their imagination is preset. The children aren't able to choose the right for them. Their parents should protect them from pressure. I know that it isn't easy to persuade children with quite a high level of technical education that the magic carpet and wand existe. But they also long for romantic stories. If some classic film fairy-tele appears in cinemas it's always a box-office draw .
You needn't be a fanatic freudian to understand that human creativity and taste have their roots in the early childhood or what you learn in the childhood accompan you for whole your life .
But there is another problem. Can arts protect themselves from the influence of science and technology? We know that already exist computer programmes which are able to write books and draw pictures themselves. Could happen that the most important element in arts - the man - will be useless?
Now let me quote several words from I-t'ing: ""We can't loose what really belongs to us even if we threw it away.""

203_HUEL4132.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Recently debates concerning the use of cell phones in public places have become more and more popular. However, the debates remain still debates, and they have not provided a solution for the problem of regulation yet. The establishment of a unfied mobile etiquette is considerably urgent, though. As instructions and advice have not proved to be effective enough, the etiquette and regulation of mobile phone using in public places has to be necessarily enforced by law for moral, security and healthily reasons.
First and the foremost, the prohibition of mobile phones form public places by law is morally important. Public places as theatres, cinemas, concert halls and schools are rarely respected by mobile - addicted people. They do not consider other people's entertainment important enough to switch or at least mute their cell-phones. Consequently a kind and polite callingof their attention to do so is not sufficient. Mobiles' prohibition should be fulfilled by law and also strengthen by the possibility of financial punishment.
Secondly, the lawful enforcement of the mobile etiquette is enourmously important for public security. Cell phones are already prohibited during driving vehicles, but it is also hazardous to use them during public transportation. Receiving or starting a phone call, or even reading text messages highly require peoples' attention and they cannot concentrate on invisible and dangerous factors of traffic. Mobile phones often lead to accidents, even to lethal ones. A phone call is sometimes more important than the security of someone's own life.
Another significant aspect of the issue concerns health. Using mobile phones in public places like hospitals and other social institutes of health care is not only prohibited and impolite but also very dangerous. Still there are people who are indifferent to the prohibition. Forbiding the phone calls by law would prevent disasters of pace-makers' interference with mobile phones and generally would provide a more pleasant environment in hospitals, which is essential for the patients' recovery.
Opponents of this position argue that the enforcement of mobile etiquette by law is not only unnecessary but also impossible to apply. It is necessarily difficult to carry out a lately developed ruling against the accommodated habitation, still laws of the nation have their considerably great effect on public acting.
A law is always more powerful than an advice, an instruction or a rule. Regarding the issue of mobile etiquette and the attempts that are made to enforce it is public places, the only solution available is the lawful regulation. Prohibition of cell-phones from public places provides people healthier, safer and morally more appropriate life.","However, the debates remain still debates, and they have not provided a solution for the problem of regulation yet.",B2

It seems to be the highest goal in most of the young people's lives. They do anything possible to become suitable applicants to a certain university. On the one hand the troubles they take are reasonable - after graduating you have more possibilities for a career; there are quite a lot of roads you can choose to walk along. You can even choose whether to walk or run. On the other hand, the things you study, especially here, in Bulgaria are so far away from reality that sometimes you forget what exactly your subject is .

	The huge changes in the position of women was achieved through the act of feminist. As a result, I strongly disagree with the statement that: ""feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good"". If the feministic movement would not have arised then the women would still be treated like animals in circus. We used to live in a patriarchal society were men's dominance was taken for granted. Women in those societies were not considered as human beings but only important for the extension of the human species. On the one hand men were allowed to work, to study to universities, go out and come whenever they like and not obliged to help with the house-work. On the other hand women were not allowed to study at universities, or work, they were not permitted to go out and they were forced to bring up children, cook, wash and make all the housework . 
	In addition, in our modern society women do not pocess the role they used to. They are allowed to do whatever they want, they can go to universities, decide whether marry or not and finally they are considered to be clever enough to compete with a man. But even though those changes have accured we cannot admit that we do not still live in a somewhat patriarchal society. We can admit that women are in a better position than they were in past times but when nowadays a woman is married and also working, she is obliged by the unspoken rule to do on her own the housework and to raise the children without her husband's help .
	This fact leads to the exhaustion of the woman. She has to work, to be there for her children and to take care of the house. As a result she has no time for herself. So, if we consider carefully nowadays circumstances, we will understand that not so many things have changed. Something that I should add so as not to exaggerate is that not all women face such treatment. Some men nowadays respect the role of women and the equality of the two sexes. This minority of men give hope for the future. If gradually all men and women as well start to realize the importance of both genrs and the equality of them then there will be no need for feministic discussion .
	To sum up, the feministic movement helped a great deal with the improvement of the position of women. Feminists cannot do much if we, people, especially men do not understand the basic idea of feminism and realize that no person, either man or woman, is superior of inferior to anyone else .","On the other hand women were not allowed to study at universities, or work, they were not permitted to go out and they were forced to bring up children, cook, wash and make all the housework .",B2

Money is envy, crime. Money is death... So, money is everything. All we have we have for money. If we have money we have everything. But should we have everything? That is the question. The more we have the more we want to have .
Do you want to be rich? - Yes, you do. If you said ' ' no ' ' I just wouldn't believe you .
And even if you said to your wife that you don't want to make a fortune your wife would kill you , I assure you. And what do you do to get some money? I'd like to quote a few words from a song: "" I work all night I work all day To pay the bills I have to pay - Isn't it sad?
And still there never seems to be A single penny left for me - That's too bad! ""
Don't you feel the same? You get up before darn and your working day has already begun. You spend the whole day working until absolutely worn out to go out anywhere or to enjoy your family life you fall asleep in an arm chare before your TV set. So you work from dawn till night day after day, week after week and so on , so forth. But what for?
A man's wife watches TV admiring the beautiful life shown in films. And she demands that her husband should work less , pay more attention to her and his children and still he should bring more money. Then he begins to understand that his life is unbearable. His life becomes a torture and... he commits suicide .
But let's talk more seriously. Money is the root of all evil. Do you remember the war in Chechnya? How many people died during that war! A great number of young innocent men, women, children were victims in the hands of our government. The leaders of our country made a pile by sacrificing their own people. And you know that most of the wars broke out because someone wanted to conquer new territories, nations and become the greatest in the word .
Vanity, the wish to have power, money, push a man to destroy the life of other people. For example lets speak about drug tradesmen. They make people their slaves .
For a grate sum of money a man allows himself to induce another person to lead a pitiable existence, to turn the other's life to dreadful torture. And what about drug addicts? They feel drug-made delight, pleasure, joyfulness for a few hours and they go to rob or even kill innocent people to get some money which they will pay for rotten drugs in order to forget the cruel world in their false dreams .
People steal information from each other. Then they sell it. And it doesn't matter to them why others buy that information and what they are going to do with it .
A lot of our sportsmen emigrated to the countries where they could make more money. They sell themselves, they sell their motherland. Isn't it sad?
We are the slaves of money. Even if we had fair money and we could enjoy them Could be proud of them, could we be happy knowing that other people suffer?
Money is the root of all evil. But we have no power to change it. People are too imperfect to live without money. We live for ourselves. It's against our nature. Do you remember the dream about socialism where all people are equal? To build that world was a great mistake for us .
Our vanity push us to struggle for a place under the sun. But isn't it the law of nature?
Don't animals struggle for their life? Of course animals have no money. But people are more complicated creatures than animals. So we invent end money. Animals struggle for their life without money and people struggle with the help of them .
So, what is money? Is it the way of our existence? Money seems to be the root of our rotten life full of cruelty and evil. But history knows the examples or it's better to say attempts of building society without money. They were all a crash. Then maybe the root of all evil is human nature, not money?",Our vanity push us to struggle for a place under the sun.,B2

What can be done with money and what can't be done with money is always a question in mind. Can we say that money doesn't effect our life? Or can we say that every thing is based on money? Another question which is always asked is ;can money alone bring happiness? All of these are always asked and people always wonder the answer .
It is usually said that money is the root of all evil. When thought about this deeply I think everyone will agree. Can we think or a life without money? Of course no. Nothing can be done without money. If you have money you are everything. You can do anything you want and nobody can question you because you have money and you are the king. Every body bows in front of money and people can do many things for money. If you have money you are respected by everyone and have prestige in every encounter. We can see this in everyday life very obviously. When a well-dressed person enters a shop every body tries to help and respect that person. But if a very ordinary looking person enters the shop no body bothers to help unless they are asked. Another thing is if you have money and if you are ill all the doctors work for you. Nothing would be impossible. You can see the best doctors and be cured in the best way. Your children can get the best education opportunity and all doors would be wide open for you. They can go to the best colleges, have extra lessons, attend many social activities and even if they cant enter a good university they can go to private ones. You can buy everything your child wants and let him life the most comfortable life .
When looked from this perspective everything is fine but there is the other side of the story. What about the poor. Don't they have the right to live a well life. But no, if you don't have money you are nothing. You are not respected and always seen as a third class. When a poor person is ill his only opportunity is to go to state hospitals and as we know there they act as if we are animals. Why? Because you don't pay so they don't care whether you are ill or not. Every time the doctors do the same things. Just examine you a few minutes and say ""you have nothing"". Your children don't have the right to get a good education. Because they pay little to teachers in state schools and so the teachers don't care. Why should they work hard for so little? There are many families that can't afford to send their children to universities. They can't make life worth living for their children. Doesn't this annoy the parents. Of course they feel sad not to be able to do what their children want .
As we see the great contrast between the rich and the poor we can easily see the bad effects on money. Poor people when realize the things that can be done with money they would want to live in the same way also. And what are the ways to be rich quickly. Of course stealing or killing for money. People would rob, steal to have a better life. They may kill each other to get money. They may give their soul for money even.

However, we should finally distinct them and provide all of the good and bad sides of this modern age. Are we completely overtaken by modern achievements? Are we robots, machines, emotionless and programmed or they still haven't got such a hold on us? If they have, how to deal with it and what to do?

In this connotation, we can not see bad sides of technology. Various kind of social media, ""Facebook"", ""Youtube"", ""Instagram"", people, (mainly young people) find very useful, productive and interesting. Some of them are quite inspirational, which gives the ideas for people to think more, to create more, to search more, to develop more.

People are not aware that the things we see out there, they are all fake. Most of the time. Following celebrity profiles, seeing the kind of life that they're living, seeing the way they look alike and as the result - wanting to be them, wanting to be like them.

295_LTVY3003.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"As political movement feminism began between the late 18th and early 20th century in Europe and in the United States. It was always based on the idea that women must have equal rights and opportunities as men. Several disadvantages and advantages of feministic struggle can be listed .
 One of the main disadvantages of feminism is the fact that it usually has a negative meaning to most people. This is a sequence of the tendency for feminism to occur in waves when each of it represents different kinds of feminists who often disagree among themselves on certain issues. For example, the members of earlier generation are being criticised by the later ones, who claim that there is still too little of attention being paid to women's problems. Consequently, another disadvantage appears as the cause of these disagreements. For instance, feminists of later generation believe that the society is still very patriarchal, and women are oppressed by it. For this reason, their attempt to make women dominate in society cannot lead to equality between the two sexes .
 But I think that there are more advantages that women gained from feminism than disadvantages. First, for women in many countries, the area of politics was forbidden for a long period of time. Until it was an exceptionally male activity, women neither could vote in the elections, nor took their part in ruling the country. As a matter of fact, feminists were the first ice breakers that changed the situation radically. Now women have equal rights as men to control the machinery of government and express their political opinion by voting. Second, notwithstanding sex, everyone today has a right to study and get a desirable profession. For example, feminists have proved that women may also achieve high results in studying science as well in the faculties of arts or women as well as men are good physics, doctors, and even astronauts. Finally, sexism is always a thorny question in feministic discussions because it occurs in different situations of life and causes many problems for women. Trying to get a particular type of job is one of the cases when women may confront with an unfair treatment of them because of their sex. For many years feminists struggled against this kind of phenomenon trying to stop it. Actually, they have already represented noticeable achievements. As a result, in most of well developed countries in Europe and in the United States women have equal opportunities as men to get a job. The great majority of employers organises competitions to choose one of the candidates not according to their sex but according to their skills and experience which is necessary in that job .
 To sum up, no matter what was achieved feminists believe that women are still oppressed in comparison with men, and that their oppression is unjustified. However, their struggle has done more good than harm to the cause of women because the attitude towards women has changed in many positive ways. Nowadays women are treated equally to men in politics, education, and workplace .",The great majority of employers organises competitions to choose one of the candidates not according to their sex but according to their skills and experience which is necessary in that job .,B2
341_NOUO1094.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"After reading the statement above I was puzzled as to how I would approach the problem and a little curious to know in what context that person uttered such a statement. My next problem concerned how I would analyze what s/he was referring to at the time .
When I looked up the word feminism in my dictionary I fond that feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of sexual equality"". But the quation above does not refer to feminism per definition but to feminists, people who supposedly fight for feminism. Hence , I think the problem the person wants to address is what we in retrospect can see as a consequence of feminist ""extemity"", that culminated in the 1970s. At the late sixties and early seventies society in the western world seemed ready for an open discussion on the issue of women and their traditional roles as mother, wife and housekeeper. This was due to changes in the political climate and society as a whole. Women began to group themselves in organisations such as Women's Liberation. This happened especially in relation to the hippie movement and other young radical groups who were prominent in society and forced people to hear their message. The ""extremism"" of certain feminist organisations was only a necessary rebellion against what was felt as supression and degeneration of women that had been going on far too long. In my humble opinion, I believe this was an inevitablereaction to an existing androcentric world both in academic circles, the working place and the domestic sphere. Many women felt they were both marginalized and invisible as both subjects and objects, especially in academic studies. And they called for a feminist critical consciousness. In retrospect there has been a tendency to point to the reprocutions of the feminist movement. People claim it has broken up homes. They see the high divorce rate as a direct consequence of women's liberation. Also , the fact that women started to work outside the home and the children have been left in daycare are highly debated. Some members of society, expecially christian right oriented groups, blame women's liberation for legalising abortion, and see pro-choice activists as an abomination. The see women's lib. activities as devastating to the cause of women, since motherhood should be a woman's first priority. Other people praise feminists and feminism, asserting that without it women would still be unjustly reduced to an existence inside the home. In contemporary society, people seems tired of the whole subject matter of female versus male. There has been a shift in focuse away from women and on to gender, which concerns itself with man and woman in mutual interdependence. This is especially recognisable in academic studies. Contemporary women's studies does now presuppose a twentieth-century (twentyfirst - century) holistic anthropology. Here the human being is defined as sexually differentiated. It is not longer split into male or female body and a sexless, rational soul. Women studies make a clear distinction between sex as biologically determined and gender as culturally constructed .
The utterance ""Feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women"" has very little ot no relevance at this time in history. It is a new millenium and people are generally no longer interested in the dichotomy women and men. We are all a human entity and the cause of women is outdated. We are now looking at the cause of mankind .","In my humble opinion, I believe this was an inevitablereaction to an existing androcentric world both in academic circles, the working place and the domestic sphere.",C1
386_POSI2071.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Why are some students successful at language learning while others are not?
Why is the foreign language sometimes easy for one group of people and difficult for the other at the same time?
People involved in language teaching often say that students who really want to learn will succeed whatever the circumstances in which they study. The biggest factor affecting their success is the motivation that students bring to class. Motivation is some kind of ""internal drive"" that encourages somebody to pursue a course of action .
If we perceive a goal and that goal is sufficiently attractive, we will be strongly motivated to do whatever is necessary to reach it. Language learners who are motivated perceive goals of various kinds; short-term goals and long-term goals .
In general, strongly motivated students with long-term goals probably learn easier than those who have no such goals .
Apart from the motivation, physical conditions have great effect on learning the foreign language (not necessarily English). When people get older their speech organs are stiffer. It would be much easier for children to develop pronunciation skill than for adults. In general, English is easily and willingly learned by children. It is very good for children to start learning English at the age of six or seven .
The English grammar rules are not very complicated, especially at the beginner's stage, so they are very easily learned by the students .
Success in learning English as a foreign language depends on the learner's nationality. It is very important what the learner's native language is. For Chinese, for example, English would be more difficult than for any other European because these two cultures, Chinese and English, are very distant. Germen, on the contrary, would be better learners at English because these two languages are not very distant (some words are even similar).
Although Polish grammar is different from English one, Polish students don't have bigger problems with understanding and acquiring the English rules .
English has a special position since it has become the international language of communication. It has become very fashionable as well. You can meet English everywhere: TV, radio, computers and even in the street .
Nowadays, especially in Poland, everything what comes from America is the best. When you go to the cinema you can see mostly an American film and hear real American accent, on the radio most songs are in English but not necessarily singing by an Englishman or an American. A lot of songs are written in English because they sound better and more people could understand them. English is present also in computers so if you want to operate the computer you have to know the language .
As I said English is present everywhere now because it has become extremely popular these days. Everybody wants to learn it and know it as it's the most fashionable language in the world. It sounds nice and it's easy to learn. If compared with any other language (Polish, for example) I must say that it's not complicated at all .",As I said English is present everywhere now because it has become extremely popular these days.,C1

This definition does clarify the meaning of the phrase ""capital punishment"" but it does not provide any justification for the use of the death penalty. It seems to me that asking ""what"" capital punishment is is not as important as the question ""why"" it is still in use. In many countries all over the world hell is still being raised over the controversial question whether death penalty should be abolished or not .
Some religious faiths are based on the bible or at least on parts of it. Many people consider themselves to be true believers, so why should they not live by the laws of the book of books? Why should they not [Quotation] [Reference] ? And why should they not abide by the biblical law, [Quotation] ? [Reference] Many western European societies seem to have realized that the texts of the bible are outdated. Since the age of the Enlightenment the death sentence has been highly critizised. Although this kind of punishment was controversial since the 18th century, many countries abolished the death sentence only a few years ago. The Federal Republic of Germany for example abolished capital punishment in 1949 whereas former East Germany used this kind of punishment up to the reunion of east and west in 1989. The Austrian government, which used to carry out the death sentences by hanging, decided in 1919 not to use death penalty anymore. So did Switzerland in 1937. France, which had many spectacular beheadings, only abolished the death penalty in 1981. The United States government also decided to abolish death penalty in 1972, but unfortunately, some states of the Union reestablished capital punishment in 1976 and still use it today (cf. Brockhuas) 1961 the British lawyer Peter Benenson founded Amnesty International (ai). The organization aims to help prisoners who were arrested for religious, racial or ethical reasons, provided they did not approve of or use violence. Every year ai members plead for the release of about 5000 prisoners. The organization holds conferences and initiates actions against the violation of human rights. There is a high demand for organizations like ai as the high number of executions in 1984 sadly documents . 1125 verifiable executions in 44 countries worldwide seem to be a cry for help. ai was awarded the Nobel peach price in 1977. (cf. Fischer Weltalmanach 1988).
The Afro-American Edward Earl Johnson was sentenced to death by a jury in Louisiana for murdering a white women. The verdict was based only on the statement which Johnson had given under the pressure of policemen forcing him to repeat their words at pistol point. Although his family and his lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court several times, Edward E. Johnson was executed in the early eighties after spending only a comparatively short period of time on death row. According to Amnesty International, Mr Johnson is the 24th innocent individual since 1961 who was executed .
In the United States there is a steady increase in the number of criminal actions. Therefore the need for solutions is crucial. The President of the country, Bill Clinton, and his staff developed a bill which is currently discussed in congress. Besides employing an additional number of policemen Bill Clinton proposes that the death penalty should be reestablished for another 47 crimes. Apparently Bill Clinton concludes that a greater number of executions will act as a deterent for other criminals. Of course, the intensification of the death penalty will not be the only novelty. The new bill on gun purchase seems to have far more potential of being effective. The authors of this bill suggest that there should be a five day interval between the application for a weapon and the actual receipt of the gun. In those five days police could inquire about the potential purchaser. But it will not be easy to make this bill a law because the gun lobby is very powerful in the United States .
In the United States crime is beyond the point where it can be controlled by police. State penitentiaries are overcrowded and there are no social programms which help to keep the youngsters of the streets. Statistics say that the number of 14-17 year old murderers has increased by 124% from 1986-1991. Teenagers experience so much violence on the streets that the thought of dying does not really frighten them anymore. The death sentence therefore loses its purpose, if it ever had one .","Many people consider themselves to be true believers, so why should they not live by the laws of the book of books?",C1

This has been repeated in American media for last several years. Such hints have appeared in Czech press too, though feminist movement has not influenced our society much yet. Susan Faludi writes about this phenomenon in her book ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women"". She says that many women do not want to call themselves feminists, though they think women's movement is still neccessary. Faludi claims it is not feminists but the continuous campaign of the White House, press and Hollywood against feminism, who are to be blamed for women's unhapiness. Who is right the, Faludi or media?
Nothing in life is so simple. The answer is much complicated and the causes of the problem lie deep in our minds. People of the end of the 20th century are used to systematic thinking. The flow of information is overwhelming and we are afraid of the complexity of the world. That's why we need to put everything in a group: works of arts, , people, their opinions, ideas. Everything has to be classified, everything has to be clear. If you say something that is considered a feminist idea, then you are proclaimed a feminist. If you say something against feminists, you are proclaimed sexist. Never mind what your doings are; what other people think you are - that is what matters most. This systematizing the world brings people relief; they believe they have beaten the complicated and hardly understandable world. But the result is not so pleasing: we do not understand one another .
Why don't we understand one another even when we use the same words? We speak in categories and classes when we discuss a problem. But everybody has a slightly different idea of the same category or class and eventually we do not speak about the problem but about what we mean by our words .
We can use a metaphor to describe this incident: we buy wine according to the label on the bottle (without being able to tell the difference), and also we do not discuss the quality of wine but the brand of it .
As far as feminism is concerned, the result of such attitude is blaming feminists for women's unhapiness. What is actually feminism. It came into being in 19th century when women were totally dependent on men, could not vote and work. Suffragettes are also classified as feminists (this women's movement at the turn of the century became famous for its agressivity), as well as other movements in the 30s or 60s, some of them very radical. S. Faludi says that during the feminist revolution in the 70s feminism was understood as an effort to bring women the same rights that men have always used. Carola Biedermannova; a Czech feminist answers the same question this way: ""Feminism is making women's economic, political and social rights work in real life."" Those definitions are the same as one definition in Webster's dictionary: ""organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests."" But definition 2 says that feminism is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes .
Well, what do we mean when we say someone is a feminist? Does that mean that he or she fights for women's rights or that he or she only believes in the equality of the sexes? We cannot blame a group of people for something when we don't even know who belongs to this group .
No, it is not feminist's fault that some women are unhappy. It is obvious that women needed their movement because they were not socially free. Now they are or at least they can e. If they are unhappy, it is neither feminists' nor anti-feminists fault. The reason is in them and in all of us who cannot get rid of the old view of woman. Our attitude towards woman does not accord her new position in society. But this is not a political problem, it is a problem of human culture, a problem of bad communication .
We should strive for making our communication work again. It is no use to contemplate whether someone fits to a certain category, either feminist or sexist. We should rather try to listen to what he tells us and how we can help him. Then we will understand one another .",We should rather try to listen to what he tells us and how we can help him.,C1
387_RUMO2020.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The problem of the university degrees can be viewed differently. There are certainly some people who consider high education degree to be useless in the sense of its actual practical use. I myself do not agree with this statement. I think that education is one of the most important parts of our lives. It is the basis of the person's whole life. Education gives a person a better appreciation of such fields as art, literature, history, human relations, and science, it is intended to help young people indentify, choose and prepare for a career, it helps people enjoy richer, more meaningful lives. Unfortunately nowadays a great number of the universities appeared in our country that do not provide their students with the actual, valuable education, but I am rather optimistic as far as this situation is concerned. I think that such institutions will soon cease to exist being really useless .
The educational system is constantly changing. There are certainly quite a number of problems in this process, some questions have already been solved, others are still to be answered. By way of solving the problems the whole system is developing .
Historically universities developed from the cathedral and monastery schools. Their development took place so slowly that it is difficult to know the point at which they became universities. Thus, the first universities in Europe appeared in the 1100's or may be 1200's. Those universities provided the unified teaching of such disciplines as low, medicine, and theology and they were rather general than specilized. These courses were gradually broadened .
The point used as the title of the present essay perhaps had been discussed time and again by those people who were concerned with the educational system even in the 18th century. If we look closely at the historical development of the university education we will be able to see the reflection of the problem in question. To my mind, a growth of specialization reflects the point in question .
During the 1800 specialization in knowledge was increasing. Many Institutions were created to train students in such fields as agriculture, medicine, engineering, and commerce. Specialization also resulted in an increased emphasis on advanced study. Thus, education for professions overshadowed the liberal arts .
Now everything is changing the other way round. We can see another tendency: most of the educators agree that students need a broad education as a basis for whatever field attracts them .
From my point of view, this basic broad education should be humanitarian .
In our country in 1950's and also in 1970's technical specialization was of primary importance, but humanitarian education did not have any practical value. I do not mean to say of course that technology is not all important. I mean that the real scientists should have and do have broad education .
The word ' humanities' comes from Latin ' homo ' - ' human ' . Thus humanities study everything that is connected with the human beings, the most important facts in the development of the human civilization. This is the knowledge we should take into consideration!",The word ' humanities' comes from Latin ' homo ' - ' human ' .,C1
389_RUMO4001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"People get used to the achievement of civilisation very quickly. One can hardly imagine a modern apartment without a TVset, a radio or a telephone. Nobody understands how we had been able to live and communicate before these useful things were invented. I wonder if people felt the same when telephone first appeared. It was just a miracle: one didn't need to leave one's house and go somewhere. All one had to do is to take the receiver, to dial the number and to tell anything he or she wanted to convey. I am not against telephone at all, it makes life convenient and comfortable. It makes life easy, but in some sense it separates people, their relationships grow distant. Why to go to see your friends when you can always ring them up. As a result there are so many telephone friends now, when people don't see each other for years but call themselves close friends. I don't think it is a communication in the proper sense, it is just the illusion of it, an ersatz communication, so to speak .
Cinema brought to our life the idea of mass media. As a matter of fact, it doesn't separate people. On the contrary while watching a film one is overwhelmed with the feelings which most of the time are shared by the whole audience. An opinion poll has been conducted recently to find why people go to the cinema. The most common reason was to escape for a moment from this dreary life. Therefore we can say that cinema spreads two great illusions: illusion of living a more interesting and attractive life and illusion of collective or mass consciousness. But still cinema is not so powerful as television because people go to the cinema only occasionally. Television is a much more effective way to influence people's minds. We can say that it combines three features which have been mentioned above: illusion of living a better life, illusion of mass consciousness and illusion of communication. We have surrendered to its power, and now it plays a very important role as the centre of our life. What is the most common thing today? People come home, switch on their tv set and let it work for the rest of the evening. And at weekends, when films go one after another without any pause, they stay at home all day long. Television seems to be a sort of drug which we have grown addicted to. I think it would be useful to try and single out those characteristic features of television which distinguish it from other means of mass media. Unlike radio it appeals to our ability to see and to hear, its visual and aural impact on us is very strong. Unlike cinema which contains a personal attitude and presupposes a personal interpretation, television is neither artistic, nor personal. It uses words to put some idea into our heads depriving us of an opportunity to think in a different way. Therefore it may serve as an excellent means to rule a country as religion used to be, and it was realised in the Third Reich where television was turned into the official means of state propaganda and governmental control .
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that television as a product of progress brought some good things into our lives but there is hardly any need to mention them because they are familiar to everyone. I wanted to discuss only those negative features of television which may balance the positive ones and help to estimate objectively its role in our life .",The most common reason was to escape for a moment from this dreary life.,C1
375_POPZ1044.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Man has always dreamt of making his life easier. Primates had to struggle for survival and try to improve harsh conditions of life. With time, man started to feel secure and warm in his cave; yet, out of greediness he wanted more and more ... He dreamt of better life with permanent light inside his dwelling place, he dreamt of being able to fly and move from place to place quickly and easily. Most of his dreams came true and man became an advanced creature who managed to achieve a lot thanks to the power of reason. But a price had to be paid for this ...
Now man has everything his forefathers dreamt of but does it mean that he does not dream any more? And here a paradox arises - man wants to go back to his roots. He longs for a quiet, peaceful life, far from the sight of sky-scrapers and traffic jams. Of course it is mere wishful thinking as we have gone too far in our run for making our lives better and it is practically impossible to turn back now .
It is obvious that our lives are dominated by modern science and technology - we are victims of our own creation - but I would not agree that there is no place for dreaming and imagination in this world. Very often people are simply ashamed to admit it but dreams have always been an important part of their lives. The fact that we live in the age of spacecraft does not mean that imagination has been rejected. It may not be as explicit as it was in Homer's days when Greeks lived in the world full of gods created by their own imagination, but it is present in our lives. Like our Victorian predecessors we feel endangered by the development of science and technology and that is why we try to escape into the world of dreams. It is possible by means of literature and Disney lands. The former is very fertile. It has always been the means of giving way to emotions of various kind and imagination running wild. Writers, poets in particular, have tried to show the beauty of the world and contrasted it with the ugliness of big cities and their industrial development. Some film makers have also used their imagination in order to create an unreal but beautiful world of fairies and good spirits, and as an outcome we have such films as ""Hook"" or Disney productions. I remember how sad I was after watching ""Hook"" and how I kept asking myself, ""Why don't we live in a fairyland where everything is so pretty and simple? Good wins over evil and everybody is happy?"" But then I came to the conclusion that this world is in fact inside us and we are the only ones who can make it live on or die .
A Disney land is a paradise not only for children but also for adults. It is a place where grown-ups forget about the existence of taxes, bills, morgages, etc. It is a place where time has stopped and where everyone forgets about their problems just for a while .
But not only is there a tendency in art to escape into the world of dreams but also in architecture. People get and tired of concrete and iron and they seek after solitude in the countryside. The cottages adorned with flower baskets are a truly delightful sight and to me they are an expression of people's longing for simplicity and peacefulness .
I have tried to show that people of all ages have had various dreams and desires. It is obvious that they differ from age to age but they have always been and always will be present in mankind no matter how more advanced we may become. And I really do hope that Aldous Huxley's gloomy prophecies presented in his novel [Reference] will never come true and that people won't turn into unfeeling creatures deprived of this precious thing called imagination .",It is a place where time has stopped and where everyone forgets about their problems just for a while .,C1
181_GRAR3036.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The feministic movement which made its appearance in the second half of the 19th century, has undoubtedly achieved much in changing the condition of a woman's life over the previous years. As a matter of fact, women can nowadays vote, work, study and, generally speaking, do almost everything that a man does. But is this really for women's good or all these feministic ""achievements"" resulted rather in harm than good?
	To begin with, no one can deny that women's predicament, during previous years, was suffocating. Women lived under the dominance of men and they were entitled to live through and for domestic sphere. In other words, they were supposed to fulfill the role of a dutiful mother and obedient wife, while they were excluded from any kind of social life, they did not have access to education, as they were confined to domesticity, and they couldn't even leave their house without their husband's omission, otherwise they should give a proper excuse for their absence. In fact, patriarchal authority was always there to impose severe punishment to those women who made any attempt for independence and, especialy, to those who could adhere not easily to the sexual pattern they had been taught to follow. These restrictions, in combination with the patriarchal punishments, even reached death sometimes, usually with the excuse that particular women were peculiar, mentally unbalanced or, simply, disobedient to their husbands. Obviously, divorce was not a typical solution, as only man had the right to abandone his wife if he wanted .
	Nowadays, all these have pretty much changed; women are no longer considered to be treated as something inferior than men, and the same opportunities are offered to both, as far as education, politics and occupation is concerned, in the name of the equality of two sexes. However, it seems that the obligations of women have now has dramatically increased, as they now have to work outside their house and inside, as well. That happened because real equality between men and women have not really been achieved yet. Indeed, women have now to face the same burden of housekeeping, which has traditionaly remained a woman's duty, together with the job responsibilities that she now has. And it would be an omission not to add, here her primary role of being a mother, as well .
	Consequently, women are nowadays, torn out of complicated duties, and they're exausting themselves in a race with which they try to prove that they're capable of everything. They want to be successful businesswomen, to keep their houses clean and tidy, to spend time with their children, to try to go the gym in order to be still desirable to their husbands, and, maybe find some time for themselves to spend with their own friends. Obviously, such thing is not possible because you cannot do many things and still be good in all of them. Nobody can do it because nobody is made from steel (not even women!)
	The solution for women's overburdened situation is not, of course, to return to the old patriarchal system, which not only denies any right to women but it also dehumanizes them. On the contrary, it relies on each man's personal feelings for his own wife. In other word, men should take action in the housekeeping, as well, instead of expecting everything to be done from their own wives. In this way, equality will not stay outside the family, but will be in depth, instead of a superficial word, which has only deteriorated women's predicament .","To begin with, no one can deny that women's predicament, during previous years, was suffocating.",C1
196_HUEL4074.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Cell phones with internet access are the smash hits of today because they enable lazy people to keep up relatively good relationships with others in strictly 160 characters, or a few minutes chatting per day. The reason why this is accepted is this ""running world we live in nowadays."" Since most of the people do not complain about the impersonality of mobile phones, the most private and prescious things are communicated through these devices. This leads to the excessive use of cell phones which only results in people growing apart.
Even though the mobile companies claim they help people stay in touch, they do exatly the opposite and further more they create cell phone addicts. The ads everywhere about the brilliance of new phones makes people believe that they are only important and lobed of they get texts and picture messages every day. People are deceived into believing that a few seconds of typing show care, and that mobile devices are capable of transferring feelings.
Thus, they are not afraid of carrying out the most important conversations through mobile phones. Unfortunateéy, however, the little machines tend to run out of batteries right in the middle of these most prescious discussions leading to horrible misunderstandings and arguments. All because of people trusting networks and machines more then each other.
We should remember that cellphones are meant to be last resorts and not a substitution for real - life relationships and conversations. In fact, texts and chats do give hundreds of opportunities to carry out white lies which will surely go unnoticed. You cannot hear the voice of the sender, you do not see the face, and the place he/she might be at. For example, a text message to the worrying parents such as ""I am fine, at my friends place"" coming form a pub, typed by a friend while the supposed sender is lying passed out, will save the mobile owner a family argument on alcohol, but without doubt makes parents and child grow further apart.
To add a different aspect, I would like to mention that the limited number of words in chats and texts lead to further problems in relationships or even business matters. Senders tend to gain space and time by leaving out words such as ' please ' and ' thank you ' which makes texts rude, and more impersonal, if possible. This is an aspect proving that mobile communication was originally meant for help in cases of emergency and not for solving family matters or carrying out complete business conversations.
To sum it up, I believe that mobile communication is not the right means to keep in touch with one's loved ones because it is highly impersonal and deceptive, these networks and devices cannot be trusted, and the features of texts and chat enable people too easily to lie. Furthermore the limited number of characters makes these messages way too much to the point and often very rude. Therefore, we should tresure mobile communication as a huge help when in emergency, and carry out our personal and business matters face-to-face; no matter how old-fashioned it might sound.","To add a different aspect, I would like to mention that the limited number of words in chats and texts lead to further problems in relationships or even business matters.",C1
468_TRCU1103.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The death penalty is a necessary evil that has a positive effect on society today. It is an effective deterent of crime as well as a safeguard for society. It also helps to keep order in our cities. Furthermore, I fell it is a just and effective punishment for those who have commited crimes heinous enough to deserve death. Does the death penalty truly deter crimes and murder? This question is at the heart of a heated political controversy over the punishment. Opposers to the death penalty say no because of the large amount of people on death row today .
Imagine, a good friend of yours. Better yet, imagine a loved one, perhaps a little brother or sister or son or daughter. Now try to imagine life without them, simply because the murderer thought that he was above the law. Who knows, maybe he or she was just bored and decided to take a life. What if someone took the life of your child or loved one? What are we to do about the person (s) , such as these murderers who decide that they can take a loved one's life. Obviously, anyone who takes one's life, other than self defense, should not ever be let out into everyday society to function in everyday life, because such as this are from normal. Those that prey on the weak will always prey on them. A majority of those convicted and sentenced to capital punishment were repeat offenders that continually prey on the weak and innocent
I think the capital punishment is applicable in cases involving murder, but it becomes clearly easy to come up with this suggestion of punishment in cases involving the murder of the ones put in charge of protecting us and our community. Killing a cop is like shattering or killing that thin blue line that seperates between civilization and anarchy. Police officers are the ones who keep the streets safe for our society and uphold our society's beliefs. It is just I know better than anyone else and nobody is going to tell me what to do .
The deterrence factor is the likeliness of one not to committ a crime as a result of being aware of the consequences of the crime. Many argue that the death capital punishment does not deter. However, by simply convicting a person to confinement for a certain crime with an easy sentence, is much like receiving a simple slap on the wrist for committing serious crimes. Punishment, when speaking on serious terms, is socially valuable because it deters criminals from repeating their crimes and may keep others from repeating the same acts. If in fact the deterring effect misses its point, it is the fault of the justice system the all the red tape found behind it. At its current standing, the system is viewed as a joke because no authority is taken, no one believes, let alone fears, the system. Both the lengthy time and the high expense result from innumerable appeals, including many technicalities which have little nothing to do with the question of guilt or innocence. If these wasteless 
amount of appeals were eliminated or at least controlled, then the procedure would be much shorter, less expensive and more efficient .
Many argue that the capital punishment violates human rights, yet, they do not question the reason or action that got the convict on death row in the first place. Every person has an equal right to life, until they take another's life, then all bets are off . Society does not understand that when a convict on death row is executed it is because they, themselves took some innocent person's life which caused them to be put there. The only impression given about the capital punishment should be the fact that murder is a crime punishable by death. The capital punishment is in no way hypocritical it simply shows a country that murder has very serious consequences and has a fit and just punishment. The main purpose here is to instill fear in other men, to show that this will not be tolerated and justice comes first, always .
Anger is simply an expression of caring about one's moral community and society needs more men and women who care for each other and who do for the sake of others. It is passion which allows us to act for reasons having nothing to do with selfish or mean calculations. Nothing but the simple desire for justice to be served influences the upholding of the capital punishment. Punishing is the only way we have any chance at preserving our moral community and passion also acts as a protector. The capital punishment is not a settled issue and, indeed, continues to an issue of enormous emotion and importance. It, therefore, will always accompany controversial and difficult debate .","A majority of those convicted and sentenced to capital punishment were repeat offenders that continually prey on the weak and innocent

220_IRMA07036.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Everybody has the right to live in a safe society. Sometimes, this safety is under the threat by those who break the law. These criminals are responsible, so they must meet the consequences of their actions and this happens by putting them in jail. Some people believe that by punishing inmates, we can prevent them from committing more crimes, while others believe that we have to put all efforts to reform them. In fact, we should make a balance between controlling and reforming them.
	Many people think that the first and foremost justification for prisons is mere punishment. I believe they say so because punishment can be the easier solution in hand, this can be also because we have the habit of punishing even in our daily life. If a child misbehaves, her mom or caretaker punishes her for her wrong deed. Instead of thinking in depth and finding the reason behind her action they threat the child to punish her, and the degree of punishment varies according to her action. For sure, punishment can reduce wrong deeds, but for sometimes. In this case, the child will find the courage, because she has tasted the punishment and she is not scared anymore. Punishment alone may not be enough. Not all behaviors are changeable through punishment. So, the point here is that if we punish criminals, our community can be protected in a short run, but how about the long run?
	Some other people believe that prisons should be a place to rehabilitate. Rehabilitation means providing therapy and education classes for prisoners in hope that they experience a normal life in future. This is great, but not everyone wishes to be rehabilitated. It all depends on the individual's decision, whether he wants to change or not. Since we are not aware of their motives for doing the crime, rehabilitation can get even harder. Based on all these things, if the criminal justice system spends huge amounts of money and time and energy on prisoners, that would be a waste.
	In fact, I do believe that punishment and rehabilitation should be seen as complementary. Our purpose for imprisoning inmates must be punishing them in the first place, but more importantly, making sure that this is helping them to behave like a normal person in their society. By punishing, I do not mean treating them inhumanly. In fact, criminals should be treated in a way that we expect them to treat when they are released in future. They should receive care and respect, so that they will be able to give them to others. If we segregate them from society to punish them, they will explode and commit more crimes when they come out of jail. To me, reform does not mean taking it easy on prisoners. They should not receive leniency; instead, they must do long hours of hard work with no payment. There must be tough rules and desciplines. Inmates must be aware that everything has a pay off. At the same time, there must be therapy classes to provide an opportunity to change the way they think and act and stop them from committing further crimes. Therefore, based on what stated, combining punishment and rehabilitation can be the most effective strategy that the criminal justice system can use.","Some people believe that by punishing inmates, we can prevent them from committing more crimes, while others believe that we have to put all efforts to reform them.",C1
296_LTVY3004.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Although feminism has many forms and shapes, the main goal of it is to liberate women. Feminist movements started in the nineteenth century in the United States. However, the first feminists who joined the movement were treated more as individualists. Since then the strategies how to achieve and maintain equal rights in a masculine society have changed and developed. Most feminists are especially concerned with social, political and economic inequality between men and women. The majority of modern feminists believe that discrimination of women still exists wordwide. This essay is concerned with the the positive and negative causes of feminist movement. Since there are several points in favour to feminists, there are more things to be said to criticize modern feminism .
 The main advantage of the movement is that it has shown women's ability to fight for their rights in the society. First of all, women achieved the right to university education. After achieving this, they proved that women are better learners than men. The fact is that women now outnumber men in both high school graduation rates and university enrollment. Secondly, women are now free to participate in any sphere. This means that a woman can choose whether to sit at home with children or to run a bussiness, become a polititian and etc. If following, women are now free to initiate divorce proceedings. Feminist movements help women feel equal to men in the spheres of education, job and family .
 However, feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women. Firstly, after getting equal rights, women became in many ways similar to men. For example, it is now natural for women to demonstrate aggressiveness, dominance and even to dress like men. To continue, modern society puts a psychological pressure on every woman. This means that if a woman does not have a career, she might be treated as weak. Similarly, a woman who has a carrier cannot be equally devoted to her family. As a result, there are much more divorces than ever before. The growing numbers of children who rarely see their careerist mothers seem scary. What is more, there is a tension between men and women who want to dominate in the social sphere. Present situation shows that women compete among themselves more often than before. Moreover, men are now afraid of women's wish to become even more powerful in the society. By entering the social sphere, women not only become strong competitors but also act similarly to men .
 To sum up, feminism ideas can be viewed as positive for women because they encouraged them. Because of feminist movement, women have more or less the same rights in the society as men. However, the feminism movement have lost its positive values especially in the past ten years. Women entering from domestic to social sphere caused confusion in the society. By extension, more and more women forget their domestic roles and become career women. Seeking for career is seen as an advantage, but then someone has to be concerned with domestic matters as well .",This essay is concerned with the the positive and negative causes of feminist movement.,C1
426_SENS3012.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Does money cause all our problems? It is a very frequently asked question these days, with a plethora of different answers and opinions. Some claim that with money everything is easier; some claim that a piece of paper cannot make your life better. But, one cannot deny, the whole world spins around money.
There are actually two different worlds - the rich one and the poor one. In the world full of money, expensive cars, luxurious mansions, glamour and glitter everything seems to be perfect. Looked from the outside, it really does seem perfect. However, there is much deeper and darker side hidden beneath all that shine. If you look closer into lives of, for example, famous persons, it is not happiness that you see. No. It is dissatisfaction, anger, helplessness. One cannot resist asking ""Why? Why, when they have everything they want?"" Now comes the question of what is really the thing humans want. Cars? Clothes? Expensive hotels? Overloaded bank accounts? People who have all these things do not actually care about them. They are slaves to their fortune. What is the purpose of a huge house if you live there alone? What is the purpose of millions and billions if you have no one to spend them with?
Next are a little less rich people, those who own companies or have well paid jobs so they can afford themselves a luxurious life. Those are people who are never at home, who pay a babysitter to raise their children because they are too busy with earning money. Those are lonely men and women who left their beloved ones or were left by them because they missed every birthday and anniversary, because they were working late. No matter how much money you have, you can never buy time. The true values do not lie in money and in things you can buy with money. Only those who have it know that.
On the other hand, there are people who have so little, almost nothing, speaking materialistically, but actually they have everything. How comes? Well, maybe a mother cannot afford to buy her children the latest phone, but she can spend some time playing with them, she waits them with hot lunch on the table, she is there to kiss them goodnight. Maybe a boyfriend doesn't have money for expensive dinner, but he will make one by himself. Maybe a father cannot buy his son a new car, but he will come to every football mach his son plays. That is the true luxury. It is shame that so many people never realize that, or when they do, it is too late.
Money is an addiction, a sickness. No matter how much you have it, it is never enough, you always want more and more. But it is not money to be blamed. After all, it is nothing more than a piece of paper. The true evil lies in people themselves. Human's greed and envy are the biggest evil force in the world. Money is not alive, it cannot consciously cause you troubles and bring you misery. It is simply a means to an end, and you are the one who decides what that end will be. The best things in life come for free, it has always been like that, and it will always be.",How comes?,C1
136_FRUC3061.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"What Marx meant by religion as the opium of the masses can be understood as followed. Let us begin with the word ""opium"". This word reminds us of the important part that religion played in the 19th century. Religion was present at the social as well as the political and intellectual level and nobody would challenge its foundation. This may explain why people were ""religion addicted"" and could do nothing without a religious approval of their behaviour. People needed religion!
Moreover, religion was an easy means for the authorities to make people accept their bad situation on earth by promising a better life after death .
If Marx was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. Let us therefore take a closer look at television as the opium of the masses .
First, it is generally agreed today that people are slaves of television. Consider the case of children. They have only just come back from school when they switch on television and watch cartoons. When their mother asks them about their homework, they answer that they will do it later. In my view, watching television should be a reward for their work .
Added to that, the breakfast television on Saturday and Sunday prevents them from sleeping, playing outside with other children, or going for a walk in the countryside. Our children do not move anymore. They are sitting all the time and do not have any physical training so that the adults of tomorrow will easier be heart patients. It is not only harmful to their health but it gives them a bad picture of society. These cartoons are full of violence, war, death and blood, which strongly influence their games and their vision of the world .
They even go as far as to believe that such a life is normal .
Secondly, television, just like religion in the 19th century, is used by the authorities to keep people in a dream .
They decide what can be broadcast or not, and they make a strong selection. Adults, like children, are slaves of television. They watch soap operas, full of love, money and beauty. Television gives them an idealistic view of life and people make more attempts to live like this than to fight against real problems. People are not interested in pollution, equality of blood, equality of sex, religion, politics or terrorism. They put off all problems. But we must make it absolutely clear that television is a way to alter the truth .
And it cannot be denied that television influences our life at a political, social and economical level. One of the most striking examples is advertising. The housewife will easier buy a product she saw on television than another, even if the latter is less expensive or of better quality. Television is far from holding the monopoly of truth. Please, think about it before switching it on!",One of the most striking examples is advertising.,C1
073_CZPR3023.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"What role does money play in human life? We can hear in words of one old song:"" Money is the root of all evil"". On the other hand a lot of people are persuaded that money assures happiness. I think it is not possible to characterize money in general. There are many points of view from which money can be looked on. I found three of them the most important : money as an essential part of life, money as a means how to make life happier and easier and money as temptation to the sin .
Money as a condition of human existence in today society has also the great influence on human freedom. The word "" freedom"" has different meaning than it had in the history. Man is free if he is not dependent on anybody. To be independent means to have enough money to be able to live. To live independently means to do whatever one wants to do and what is not against the law. Money assures that. If you have money you can buy whatever you want, you can travel wherever you want, you can realize your plans. To be financially independent means not to be afraid of what you will have for dinner tomorrow. The feeling of material security is the necessary condition for effective human activity. Everybody is aware of the value of money and does his best to have it enough. The quotation ""He who says money has no sense for human life does not mean his money but money of the others"" perfectly expresses human mentality. Money decides what place you take in the society. Money motivates people to work hard to have higher income .
Money has the power to make human life easier and more pleasant. It can even change life into paradise. This all depends on who treats the money. If people treat money in common sense it can help them to realize their dreams and to reach happiness. Everybody has different ideas on what happiness is. It can be a new car, travelling or a lot of pets. For somebody to feel happy means to help the others who need money more than the owner. By the human acts of donating money to the poor and sick people many human lives were saved .
Finally, negative human qualities can change money into the disaster. Money is the leading power of the world. People do anything to have money. Even though they can fairly work in classical way they prefer to earn money in various simplier ways - they steal, hazard with their and other's life even kill each other. Blind with the vision of wealth and better future they can not see the results of their acts - baffled fates of innocent people, baffled fates of themselves. Money works as a drug. If such a people feel how sweet it is to have money they want to have it all the time and they do everything for it. They steal and kill again and again. These people do not live normal life. They are victims of money. Not money is the root of all evil. The root of all evil is bad man with his negative qualities. Money serves as a means how to realise the evil. Money causes many disasters in family life. Because of money a perfect family can change into the pack of wolfs. Family tragedies are often caused by the question of inheritance. Children kill their parents, younger brother kills the older one, wife kills her husband. This all prove how strong position money has in human life. It has so big power that it can break the relations between the closest friends. Because of money the wars start. Because of money people do not live naturally. To gain money one has to learn to dissimilate, to trick, to lie. The lack of money causes human suffering even death. The example of this evil expresses the situation in the developing countries. Thousands of people die during one day because of famine which is caused by the poorness of the country .
Through ages mankind is characterized by the human qualities which were given to it by God. Positive qualities make the good and negative ones make the evil. Both together make the reality of life. This world has no chance to get rid of any of them. They are like energy - still constant only changing the forms. As I have mentioned money can not be characterized in general. The money in the hands of a wicked man causes the evil. An intelligent man, who knows what the real human values are, spends money in the positive way. So, money can not be characterized as a good or bad thing. It is just means by which we realize our life and fate .","Finally, negative human qualities can change money into the disaster.",C1
239_ITTO5006.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"During the Roman Empire who used to own a great deal of * pecus *, that is to say who breeded cattle, was considered rich compared to the slaves who had nothing. Consequently the word * pecus * developed into the one of * pecunia * with the meaning of richness, as we are used to consider it today. As a result, owning money man had the possibility to lighten his way to build up a decent life going for instance to a good school in order then to get a good job. Despite this, man has also seen how, throughout history, his possessions and his never-ending will of having always more have also become the root of all his evil. Therefore, why do not we finally consider the case of finding a happy balance between the two choices?
There is no doubt that man has an inner will which pushes him to obtain always something more from his capability, and money does not certainly stop this push. As a matter of fact, our modern and superficial society leads us towards buying, obtaining and possessing always more in order to be always happier. But doing so man has been reduced to a colourful, beautiful, brightly, but empty box whose appearance attracts whoever walks on the side-walk. Apropos of this, already in the 17th century Shakespeare asked himself if being or having was a solvable problem or not. The reflections of his far thoughts should be read in today's newspapers concerning the use one makes of money. How much money was spent for instance to build up soccer stadiums before the latest world championship? How about the money spent by the MAFIA to enrich its powerful and unmoral pockets? And the money spent in the illegal children trade from coast to coast of our different countries? Without continuing the list, there is no doubt that only considering the material and reluctant aspect of having money one tends to forget that before having one needs of being .
Nevertheless there is always the other part of the coin, which in this case shows how money can most of the time make people happy. And going back to the previous meaning of the word * pecunia *, it is easy to think that without something to possess and to trade, as it was for cattle, men could not eat and live. One needs to work in order to earn a certain amount of money and then live in a good way. This does not necessairly mean that one must be eager for gain, as a matter of fact there are lots of rich people that help and have helped the needed. It is shown, for instance, from various international pop singers who give part of their earnings to the third world populations. In addition, who does not remember the charitable and good works done by Lady Diana while living? And she was the future England's King wife!
Furthermore, one should step lower from the rich and famous people and see how much one can do from our less rich positions. If we had not had the right amount of money we could not face the university studies. We could not have gone to foreign countries and see the beautiful cities spread over the world. Not only can we better ourselves with money, but can we also help other people. Do we forget how many families adopting orphan children have helped them build up a new life? This has been possible not only because the future parents had a good heart, but also because money helped them to do it .
Therefore it may be concluded that doubless for many years in the past and for many years to come money could be considered the root of man's evil, but as it has been seen it is not always so. As a matter of fact is not completely true. Money and good will can cooperate to build up a good life and finding the right balance between the two one could also modify the famous book title * To have or to be?* by the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm, into * to have AND to be *.",As a matter of fact is not completely true.,C1
341_NOUO1094.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"After reading the statement above I was puzzled as to how I would approach the problem and a little curious to know in what context that person uttered such a statement. My next problem concerned how I would analyze what s/he was referring to at the time .
When I looked up the word feminism in my dictionary I fond that feminism is ""the advocacy of women's rights on the grounds of sexual equality"". But the quation above does not refer to feminism per definition but to feminists, people who supposedly fight for feminism. Hence , I think the problem the person wants to address is what we in retrospect can see as a consequence of feminist ""extemity"", that culminated in the 1970s. At the late sixties and early seventies society in the western world seemed ready for an open discussion on the issue of women and their traditional roles as mother, wife and housekeeper. This was due to changes in the political climate and society as a whole. Women began to group themselves in organisations such as Women's Liberation. This happened especially in relation to the hippie movement and other young radical groups who were prominent in society and forced people to hear their message. The ""extremism"" of certain feminist organisations was only a necessary rebellion against what was felt as supression and degeneration of women that had been going on far too long. In my humble opinion, I believe this was an inevitablereaction to an existing androcentric world both in academic circles, the working place and the domestic sphere. Many women felt they were both marginalized and invisible as both subjects and objects, especially in academic studies. And they called for a feminist critical consciousness. In retrospect there has been a tendency to point to the reprocutions of the feminist movement. People claim it has broken up homes. They see the high divorce rate as a direct consequence of women's liberation. Also , the fact that women started to work outside the home and the children have been left in daycare are highly debated. Some members of society, expecially christian right oriented groups, blame women's liberation for legalising abortion, and see pro-choice activists as an abomination. The see women's lib. activities as devastating to the cause of women, since motherhood should be a woman's first priority. Other people praise feminists and feminism, asserting that without it women would still be unjustly reduced to an existence inside the home. In contemporary society, people seems tired of the whole subject matter of female versus male. There has been a shift in focuse away from women and on to gender, which concerns itself with man and woman in mutual interdependence. This is especially recognisable in academic studies. Contemporary women's studies does now presuppose a twentieth-century (twentyfirst - century) holistic anthropology. Here the human being is defined as sexually differentiated. It is not longer split into male or female body and a sexless, rational soul. Women studies make a clear distinction between sex as biologically determined and gender as culturally constructed .
The utterance ""Feminists have done more harm than good to the cause of women"" has very little ot no relevance at this time in history. It is a new millenium and people are generally no longer interested in the dichotomy women and men. We are all a human entity and the cause of women is outdated. We are now looking at the cause of mankind .",Women studies make a clear distinction between sex as biologically determined and gender as culturally constructed .,C1
063_CZKR1007.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"""Feminists have helped women to be free and independent but they have made them unhappy"". This has been repeated in American media for last several years. Such hints have appeared in Czech press too, though feminist movement has not influenced our society much yet. Susan Faludi writes about this phenomenon in her book ""Backlash: The Undeclared War Against American Women"". She says that many women do not want to call themselves feminists, though they think women's movement is still neccessary. Faludi claims it is not feminists but the continuous campaign of the White House, press and Hollywood against feminism, who are to be blamed for women's unhapiness. Who is right the, Faludi or media?
Nothing in life is so simple. The answer is much complicated and the causes of the problem lie deep in our minds. People of the end of the 20th century are used to systematic thinking. The flow of information is overwhelming and we are afraid of the complexity of the world. That's why we need to put everything in a group: works of arts, , people, their opinions, ideas. Everything has to be classified, everything has to be clear. If you say something that is considered a feminist idea, then you are proclaimed a feminist. If you say something against feminists, you are proclaimed sexist. Never mind what your doings are; what other people think you are - that is what matters most. This systematizing the world brings people relief; they believe they have beaten the complicated and hardly understandable world. But the result is not so pleasing: we do not understand one another .
Why don't we understand one another even when we use the same words? We speak in categories and classes when we discuss a problem. But everybody has a slightly different idea of the same category or class and eventually we do not speak about the problem but about what we mean by our words .
We can use a metaphor to describe this incident: we buy wine according to the label on the bottle (without being able to tell the difference), and also we do not discuss the quality of wine but the brand of it .
As far as feminism is concerned, the result of such attitude is blaming feminists for women's unhapiness. What is actually feminism. It came into being in 19th century when women were totally dependent on men, could not vote and work. Suffragettes are also classified as feminists (this women's movement at the turn of the century became famous for its agressivity), as well as other movements in the 30s or 60s, some of them very radical. S. Faludi says that during the feminist revolution in the 70s feminism was understood as an effort to bring women the same rights that men have always used. Carola Biedermannova; a Czech feminist answers the same question this way: ""Feminism is making women's economic, political and social rights work in real life."" Those definitions are the same as one definition in Webster's dictionary: ""organized activity on behalf of women's rights and interests."" But definition 2 says that feminism is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes .
Well, what do we mean when we say someone is a feminist? Does that mean that he or she fights for women's rights or that he or she only believes in the equality of the sexes? We cannot blame a group of people for something when we don't even know who belongs to this group .
No, it is not feminist's fault that some women are unhappy. It is obvious that women needed their movement because they were not socially free. Now they are or at least they can e. If they are unhappy, it is neither feminists' nor anti-feminists fault. The reason is in them and in all of us who cannot get rid of the old view of woman. Our attitude towards woman does not accord her new position in society. But this is not a political problem, it is a problem of human culture, a problem of bad communication .
We should strive for making our communication work again. It is no use to contemplate whether someone fits to a certain category, either feminist or sexist. We should rather try to listen to what he tells us and how we can help him. Then we will understand one another .","That's why we need to put everything in a group: works of arts, , people, their opinions, ideas.",C1
218_IRMA07015.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The just way of punishing criminals has been a question which has met much controversy over the years. The ideal system of justice has undergone many changes during the decades; yet, sociologists and psychologists are unsuccessful in finding the ultimate answer . 
Many consider the current prison system to be the best solution; secluding the black sheep from the rest of the herd seems to be the easiest way after all. The criminal is to spend his time in prison and learn to adhere to the society's disciplines. That seems a fair enough treatment, but unfortunately there are some downsides to it .
The first of its disadvantages seems to be that in many cases, a criminal is not refined at all after his time in prison. He might even be aggravated by being punished so. The reason seems to be that imprisoning doesn't provide any special way of honing the felons, they are simply kept from harming other members of the society by force. Also, as they stay in their cells, angry and embittered, they inevitably socialize with their inmates, many of whom are possibly callous. Therefore, a young and rather innocent human being who had committed a somewhat minor mistake would morph into a ruthless villain. The tax paid by honorable citizens would be spent pampering people who cherish the idea of taking revenge on those same humans. That barely seems fair .
But imprisoning also has its own benefits. For instance, one is forced to face the outcome of his actions and also, in case of those who have committed unpardonable crimes, the life sentence would keep them from further harming innocent society members .
The alternate system of disciplining the delinquent is rehabilitating them. Some consider this method as being too mild and tolerant toward the offenders, but this doesn't seem to be the case. The culprit is sent to a rehabilitation center and he has to stay there for a specified time so as to be prepared for living in the society without breaking its laws. During that time, he has the opportunity to benefit from the service of professional psychologists who will help him adapt himself to rules and regulations. After his stay in the rehab center, the wrongdoer would return to the society without any feelings of resentment and with a strong desire for success and perfection .
The benefits of this particular method seem to be numerous; the offender is actually refined and elevated to some useful human being, he would not suffer from the general backlash against convicts, and is presented with clear-cut morals to help him as he faces further dilemmas later in life .
In spite of their advantages, rehabs also have their drawbacks. The expenses being high and the possibility of some reservedness on the part of criminals, are two of the doubts many share about this approach to refining offenders .
None of the systems above seem to be perfect and applicable to all societies. The underlying reason might be that each community has its own unique culture, and treating all of them with the same rules is more than simply illogical . 
Some societies, especially those who have not yet undergone drastic changes, are very strict and severe toward those who break their carefully-set laws; any redundant care or help bestowed on the villains would be considered as an encouragement of the future lawbreakings. Therefore, in a community such as the ones sketched in the previous lines, the prison system is the best approach since it is not at variance with the deep-rooted culture of its members .
On the other hand, in a more dynamic society, the rehab system seems to be the ideal solution. In such a community, people would not consider this method as being docile; because they are well aware that civilization demands the abolishment of vile systems and traditions . 
A certain system has to be chosen and adopted with great care and consideration; after all, if not compatible with the culture and beliefs of the people, it would cause many difficulties. The necessary changes in a culture need to be made gradually, allowing people enough time to adjust themselves, so that in reasonable time, adopting a wholly different system of disciplining lawbreakers would become possible","For instance, one is forced to face the outcome of his actions and also, in case of those who have committed unpardonable crimes, the life sentence would keep them from further harming innocent society members .",C1
191_HUEL4045.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Nowadays, we are overwhelmed with mobile phones, and we cannot imagine communication without them. During the last decades, they became inseparable from us as if they were part of our body. However, we seem to ignore the harmful effects caused by mobile phones. These phones, especially when used by children under a certain age, can damage the brain by changing the structure of neurons. In addition, children can easily become addicted to mobile phones which, in turn, will influence their achievement in school. Therefore, on my opinion, parents should not allow children under 14 to buy mobile phones.
There is a critical age for children, when their organs are most prone to be damaged. Under the age of 14 children's brains have not reached the developmental stage of an adult's brain, therefore they are more sensitive to the effects of mobile phones. According to several research studies carried out by medical universities, children, who used mobile phones before their fourteenth birthday, had serious mutation in their neurons which, in some cases, led to abnormal changes in their brains as well. Comparing these results with those of the control group, it was asserted that the neurons of the control group's members retained their original forms.
Besides the physiological effects of mobile phones, the psychological effects also play an important part in influencing children's life. In fact, psychological addiction can cause more damage in children's than physiological effects. For instance if a child takes up the habit of playing on his/her mobile phone all day then his/her attention will not be concentrated on his/her duties in school. As a result he/she will lag behind his/her schoolmates and this will worsen the chances in his/her later progress in school.
Parents, as the representatives of the opponent side may claim that it is useful to buy mobile phones for children even if these children are under fourteen because with the help of the phones children can be easily reached at any time. To a certain extent they may be right, however, their opinion can be debated. Few decades ago when mobile phones were even not heard of, parents knew about their children's location their programmes without the use of any technical device. In order to arrange such affairs such harmful means as mobile phones are not needed at all.
To sum up, it can be asserted that mobile phones are highly responsible for physiological as well as for psycological damage which endanger children who have not reached the age of fourteen and thus are the most sensitive to these effects. Thus, responsible parents who take into consideration their children's physical and mental health will not buy mobile phones for their children.","Parents, as the representatives of the opponent side may claim that it is useful to buy mobile phones for children even if these children are under fourteen because with the help of the phones children can be easily reached at any time.",C1
142_FRUL1004.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Marx, who was one of the great social economists and society theorists of the last century, would never have guessed, what the evolution would be in the twentieth century .
But he saw already clearly that the masses were exploited by the leading class, anyway what kind of leading class it was. So his idea was that the substrcture should liberate itself from the superstructure. If there were no more leaders, all men would be equal. But this could only happen, if the people were conscious that they were exploited and if they knew that they could change their position. Marx's idea was that the religion was the tranquilliser that calmed down the people and that prevented them from revolting against the ruling class, the factory owners and the clerics. So, he created the sentence that religion was the opium for the masses .
If we analyse this sentence, we first have to analyse the nouns ""opium"" and ""religion"". Opium is a drug and drugs can be used in different ways. They are bad if you consume them in bigger, non-pure doses and this has different consequences. You don't see the world anymore clearly as it is, you find to another kind of perception of the world, and they ease the psychological pain you suffer in this world. But drugs can be good as well. If you take the right doses, they ease your physical pain and they calm you down. Religion, and Marx meant especially Christianity, can also be used in different ways. If the believer concentrates too much on it, it might be bad, because you loose connection with the real world. You only look for your own salvation, you are no more interested in world affairs, and you might follow your leaders and think no more for yourself. But if you have the right view to Christianity, which was indeed very difficult at the time of Marx, it leads you to be critical towards society and its rulers, it makes you open-minded and friendly, and you try to treat everybody equally .
Could Marx, if he was alive at the end of the twentieth century, replace religion with television? Before answering this question, we have to analyse TV in the same way as we did with religion and opium. Things that were important for religion and opium are also relevant for television. It has its good and its bad sides. If you are not critical and don't choose but just consume, than you are overloaded with useless information, you don't distinguish anymore between reality and fiction, and you learn the wrong things because others create your opinion through TV. But if you don't watch too much and if you select carefully, you are well informed about what is going on in the world, you may learn a lot of interesting things without travelling around, and you can learn something in a short time and whenever you want with the video recorder .
If we compare the points we analysed in religion and in TV, we discover two points in common. when you have the wrong attitude to religion and to TV, you are guided by others and you are not open for changes. On the other side, you are more critical and open-minded, more open for changes when you have the right attitude towards both. But Marx would probably not have replaced religion by television because the nineteenth century is much too different from the twentieth and things have changed rapidly. Today people are much more free than people were at the time of Marx to do and not to do whatever they want. At that time, people couldn't choose to be in the church or not because there was too much pressure from society .
But today you are totally free to turn the television on or off and which channel you choose. Marx would probably have been so intelligent to take this into account .",But drugs can be good as well.,C1
092_DBAN3017.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In this essay I seek to demonstrate that it is only thanks to several feminist movements in modern Western civilization that men and women have, at least theoretically, equal rights .
Feminist or women's movements advocate same rights and chances for men and women. They try to change the present system to give women equality with men, especially in the cultural, economic and juridical areas .
These movements also want traditional role patterns to be broken down. in my opinion, many feminists grossly oversimplify these traditional role patterns when they reduce them to a matter of social convention. The difference between men and women is basically natural, it is not merely culturally, i.e. artificially, determined. In primitive life, man's natural superior strength provided protection to women, particularly while they were in the final stages of their pregnancy. This of course does not mean women are inferior to men. Political equality for every human being, man or woman, black or white, is desirable and necessary. In this context the concept ""gender"" is often used . ""Gender"" is the sex which nature has imposed upon us, it is unchangeable, we must accept it .
The problem is that women are often regarded as deviating from the male norm. It is only thanks to several great women and their accompanying movements that this norm is not as rigid anymore as it used to be. The first important feminist was the Romantic Mary Wollstonecraft, mother of Mary Shelley and author of ' A Vindication of the Rights of Woman'. Romanticism was a reaction against the preceding Enlightenment. An important idea of the Romantics was freedom of the individual, so freedom of the female individual as well .
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a group of women caused upheaval by chaining themselves to important buildings. These women called themselves ' Suffragettes': they fought for suffrage, i.e. the right to vote, for women. But the agitations did not have an immediate success. It was not until a few decades later their aim was achieved. Since then every grown-up woman has been able to vote .
Contemporary feminism developed from the postwar generation of the Sixties. From now on women occupy important positions in political, academic, cultural and economic business life. To exemplify this I only mention Margaret Thatcher, Simone de Beauvoir and Madonna .
But I do not want to give a rosy picture of how things really are. It is a fact that in everyday life men are still higher up on the social scale. For doing exactly the same job as their male colleagues, women often get paid less. The typical roles expected of women, such as staying home to take care of the children, are still taken for granted by many .
I conclude that women are still not politically equal to men, in spite of the various movements fighting for this cause. But I fear equality for all people is utopian: there will always be some who think they are superior to others .
I end with John Lennon's pun, being such an accurate rendering of reality: [Quotation]","I conclude that women are still not politically equal to men, in spite of the various movements fighting for this cause.",C1

Call it keeping up with the Joneses or a deep-rooted passion for learning for the sake of it, the number of graduated students at various levels of education in different fields is skyrocketing. Each semester, loads of alumni with their degrees are injected to the vessel of job seeking and working systems, but the question is: Can they get the most of their acquired knowledge or they are holding merely a certificate and they are literally some chassis stuffed with absurd theories, ineffective regarding to real world? Well, the question has its own proponents and opponents. Here come some of their claims:
	On one hand, advocates may say that university is a place that offers a spectrum of miscellaneous subjects. If you are smart enough, you will be able to make them work for you, even if they are just sheer theories and nothing more. Furthermore, they might say that science is based on theories, then the theory is a prerequisite to almost any kind of job, as a result, by knowing a set of theories regarding to a specific issue, you can check on different aspects and dimensions, subsequently you will be able to come up with better solutions and make up for the probable upcoming shortfalls and that is what segregates the grassroots from the elites . (In a sense that you consider a university - graduated person an elite!). So for them, universities are no vocational training place and if someone wants to get hold of such functional skills, s/he can register at a university which provides such abilities such as: University of Applied Science and Technology.
	Turning to the other side of the argument, the martinet opponents claim that the society is in desperate need of dexterous labor force, not heads inflated with theories. The moderate ones may say that theories are necessary but not sufficient. They go further that there should be a link between these written formats, their corresponding usage and the real, tangible issue, but unfortunately, in many cases, this ring is lost. They claim that instead of theories, the element of logic behind the theory and the problem should be taught, otherwise, getting hands on concrete, useless forms written in books, articles, journals, etc. can be achieved without the assistance of professors, i.e. it is not of complex nature and almost any normal, literate person with an average-to-above IQ can understand and grasp the material more or less. Then we can conclude that for them, mere theory holders have no place in a working society.
	I myself am likely to go for the second group, but at the same time, I cannot deny the very fact of this simple but oh-so-true sentence: Education is never worthless, even if it is too sheer a theory, it can come handy, at least it broadens and widens the peoples' attitudes, makes them look at the issue from another angle and also exercises their minds. To my way of thinking, we can have some solutions which a couple of them are listed below:
	We can say that if universities provide hands-on workshops alongside the material, this controversy can somehow be alleviated. One other probable solution is to run needs analysis for each occupation and design teaching materials in a suitable framework to establish the above-mentioned link.
	There still remains another problem, which is the supply and demand issue. The question is that do we really need as many graduated students in our working system - even if almost all of them are so assiduous a student - as currently we have? Or there should always be an unremitting competition for job vacancies?","Then we can conclude that for them, mere theory holders have no place in a working society.",C1
372_POPZ1010.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"An encyclopaedic entry gives such a definition of money: ' a common, unchanging equivalent of goods which marks their value and can be exchanged for them'. Its origins, dating as late as four to six thousand years ago, are connected with a sociological division of labour which found its expression in the separation of husbandry from handicraft. As a consequence, a surplus of certain goods appeared which could serve as means of exchange. Those goods which were the most transferable became directly exchangable for all the other articles and thus money originated. In the earlier ages, various commodities served as money, later precious metals such as silver and gold started to function as a general equivalent .
From this brief history of money and its invention, it can be observed that it is possible to mark an exact moment when money began to be present in the existence of the mankind. Thus the saying that money is the root of all evil seems to be rather unlogical. It is not easy to state when evil came into being, it seems to be a sort of universal category and a feature of all human beings. While evil has existed as late as our first ancestors started to inhabit the Earth, money is but a human invention, just a useful tool which makes the trade more efficient. Rather, man's love of possessing, greed and unlimited desire to have causes all the wrong which money is unjustly blamed for .
It is, however, true that money rules the world. As far as historic sources can tell us, there has always been a certain regularity concerning money. It is, the clear distinction between those who have been in possession of money and those who put a lot of effort to gain it. Moreover, what can be easily noticed is the striking disproportion between these two categories of people. The number of those, who have been trying to find out various ways of possessing it, in other words becoming rich, remains in a predominant majority to those who actually already have had it and have been rich .
My view is that it is this disproportion which can be accounted for the evil in the world, not money itself. The common lack of it, on the one hand, and demoralizing power of its excess in much fewer cases seem to be a problem. For it is a universal truth that the disturbance in balance is the source of trouble. Our society, in a result of civilisational progress, operates on such principles which condition the fact that even the most basic needs of man can be fulfilled only when paid for. Food, clothes, accommodation, entertainment, every single item in our surrounding has its price. Even human body as a whole or just its separate parts have a market value and can be sold. In fact, everything has its certain value expressed in some amount of money .
The natural and distinctive feature of all people is aiming at comfort and security. There is nothing immoral in this tendency. Further, possession of money gives many obvious opportunities and options of fuller existance. The problem appears when not everyone can achieve all the advantages simply because of the lack of money. Again, the impossibility of existing in a modern world without it is clear. The living examples might be all the people who struck by the extreme poverty have found themselves at the very bottom of social piramide, nearly loosing their human dignity. They would, for sure, attribute their status to the lack of money .
The opinion that money cannot give happiness has been functioning for ages. Is it really so? People asked for the definition of happiness would probably point at health, knowledge, security or love. Money, of course, is not a direct equivalent of all these things but if one wants to be honest, it would be necessary to admit that money, to a great extent, helps to achieve all of them .
Money itself has little value. It is just a scrap of paper or a piece of metal. How can it be, than, so powerful that, on the one hand, it may help to achieve ultimate happiness and, on the other hand, it is the underlying cause of crime, hatred, humiliation, ignorance, depravation and corruption. Money is not evil. Rather, evil which, just as good, is an innate feature of all human beings makes them treat money as a good excuse for all the wrong in the world .",Is it really so?,C1

The women's movement wants to improve the situation of women in political, economic, social and cultural respects. In these fields women have always been discriminated against .
Besides historical periods in which the position of women was relatively good, as in ancient Egypt and Rome, there were periods in which their situation was moderate or even bad, as in ancient Greece. During the Renaissance women led a comparitively good life and they were given a freer hand. From then on we see woman's position worsen .
In the eighteenth and nineteenth century the rich woman was forced to stay home doing really nothing, while the lower class woman had to work her fingers to the bone for little money. In this climate the first feminist protest was born .
If we compare the position of a woman in 1994 to that of her nineteenth century counterpart, we can conclude that feminists have already taken quite a step on the long way towards emancipation .
Today the right to vote seems self-evident to us. If women were disfranchised (almost) everybody would scream blue murder. Nevertheless, suffrage for women is a relatively recent phenomenon. In Britain women were given the vote for the first time in 1928 and the Belgian women could enter their votes only after the Second World War. In America, which did not used to be renowned as particularly kind to blacks, black men could go to the polls before white women enjoyed that same right.

In spite of obtaining suffrage, women's contribution to the political life has stayed strikingly more modest than men's. Yet we can see an evolution in the good direction. More and more political parties try to have an equal number of male and female candidates on their lists. Also the number of elected women seems to be increasing .
Emancipation of women needs more than changing laws. Feminists also react against behaviour patterns that continue the discrimination against women. They try to get rid of the steretoype of the woman as a mother, housewife and sex object .
The ideas of feminism are winning ground. Nowadays a lot of men take responsibility in the upbringing of the children and in the household .
Feminists have done a lot of good to the cause of women. But when I see how women are ' abused ' in publicity for water, soap, aspirins, light products and cars for big fellows, I think there is still a long way to go .",Emancipation of women needs more than changing laws.,C1
468_TRCU1103.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The death penalty is a necessary evil that has a positive effect on society today. It is an effective deterent of crime as well as a safeguard for society. It also helps to keep order in our cities. Furthermore, I fell it is a just and effective punishment for those who have commited crimes heinous enough to deserve death. Does the death penalty truly deter crimes and murder? This question is at the heart of a heated political controversy over the punishment. Opposers to the death penalty say no because of the large amount of people on death row today .
Imagine, a good friend of yours. Better yet, imagine a loved one, perhaps a little brother or sister or son or daughter. Now try to imagine life without them, simply because the murderer thought that he was above the law. Who knows, maybe he or she was just bored and decided to take a life. What if someone took the life of your child or loved one? What are we to do about the person (s) , such as these murderers who decide that they can take a loved one's life. Obviously, anyone who takes one's life, other than self defense, should not ever be let out into everyday society to function in everyday life, because such as this are from normal. Those that prey on the weak will always prey on them. A majority of those convicted and sentenced to capital punishment were repeat offenders that continually prey on the weak and innocent
I think the capital punishment is applicable in cases involving murder, but it becomes clearly easy to come up with this suggestion of punishment in cases involving the murder of the ones put in charge of protecting us and our community. Killing a cop is like shattering or killing that thin blue line that seperates between civilization and anarchy. Police officers are the ones who keep the streets safe for our society and uphold our society's beliefs. It is just I know better than anyone else and nobody is going to tell me what to do .
The deterrence factor is the likeliness of one not to committ a crime as a result of being aware of the consequences of the crime. Many argue that the death capital punishment does not deter. However, by simply convicting a person to confinement for a certain crime with an easy sentence, is much like receiving a simple slap on the wrist for committing serious crimes. Punishment, when speaking on serious terms, is socially valuable because it deters criminals from repeating their crimes and may keep others from repeating the same acts. If in fact the deterring effect misses its point, it is the fault of the justice system the all the red tape found behind it. At its current standing, the system is viewed as a joke because no authority is taken, no one believes, let alone fears, the system. Both the lengthy time and the high expense result from innumerable appeals, including many technicalities which have little nothing to do with the question of guilt or innocence. If these wasteless 
amount of appeals were eliminated or at least controlled, then the procedure would be much shorter, less expensive and more efficient .
Many argue that the capital punishment violates human rights, yet, they do not question the reason or action that got the convict on death row in the first place. Every person has an equal right to life, until they take another's life, then all bets are off . Society does not understand that when a convict on death row is executed it is because they, themselves took some innocent person's life which caused them to be put there. The only impression given about the capital punishment should be the fact that murder is a crime punishable by death. The capital punishment is in no way hypocritical it simply shows a country that murder has very serious consequences and has a fit and just punishment. The main purpose here is to instill fear in other men, to show that this will not be tolerated and justice comes first, always .
Anger is simply an expression of caring about one's moral community and society needs more men and women who care for each other and who do for the sake of others. It is passion which allows us to act for reasons having nothing to do with selfish or mean calculations. Nothing but the simple desire for justice to be served influences the upholding of the capital punishment. Punishing is the only way we have any chance at preserving our moral community and passion also acts as a protector. The capital punishment is not a settled issue and, indeed, continues to an issue of enormous emotion and importance. It, therefore, will always accompany controversial and difficult debate .",Nothing but the simple desire for justice to be served influences the upholding of the capital punishment.,C1
378_POSI1001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The penal code dating from the 6th century BC and invented by Hammurabi consisted of many laws concerned with crime and punishment. According to that great king, whose policies I firmly approve of, people who committed certain crimes should be punished by imposing on them the penalty equal in quality to the criminal offences those people were charged with. In other words, if someone took out someone else's eye he/she should become the victim of the same cruelty .
The times have changed since then and the range of crimes has definitely extended but the methods of dealing with the offenders have become less severe. The most typical punishment for most of the offences is the prison sentence. However, seeing the growing number of crimes this does not seem to be very effective. That is why I'm for the death penalty to be introduced or even against abolishing this kind of punishment wherever it already exists .
In my opinion if somebody is able to kill, to murder, to rape and is found notorious for committing such crimes we should not analyse his deeds from the legal point of view and wonder whether we can legally kill him or not. Although some people think this is not human to kill murderers in this way my view on that very matter is totally different. Why shouldn't we have the right to impose the death sentence on a person who murders innocent people with cold blood consequently depriving others of their beloved parents, wives, husbands or children? Why should we have mercy on people who unscrupulously rape and they ferociously torment their victims until they finally die? I would say that it would be more inhuman to let those monsters live and walk freely on the earth they contaminated with their infamous actions .
Besides, the capital punishment really helps to decrease the number of violent crimes. If we have a look at the data coming from America and going back to the 80s when the death penalty was reintroduced we can easily notice that during only two years the crime rate dropped by one fifth. This means that the danger of being executed frightened the criminals and made them realize that continuing the same ""profession"" is not a trifling matter .
Another thing which would support the idea of imposing the death penalty on criminals is the situation in prisons. As we all know, the prisons are overcrowded nowadays and the money being spent on them comes from nowhere else but the taxes paid by people. Besides, the prison system is constructed in such a way that very often it lets many prisoners out before their sentence is finished - because they, for example, behaved well. Consequently, the vision of being sent to prison creates no fear in the criminals and allows them to commit the same offences over and over again .","Consequently, the vision of being sent to prison creates no fear in the criminals and allows them to commit the same offences over and over again .",C1

206_HUEL4143.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Nowadays, almost everyone has a mobile phone and one is not surprised to hear a mobile ringing on a bus or tram. However, it is very disturbing if someone is phoning loudly on a means of transport. Mobiles ringing during a lecture or a seminar or in the middle of an intimate conversation can be even more annoying. Unfortunately, being late is not considered so badly nowadays because one can always postpone the appointment by sending a text message. Taking all these into consideration, a more intelligent use of mobile phones should be encouraged in our rushing hi-tech world.
Firstly, it is very disturbing if someone is communicating on his mobile very loudly on a bus or tram. Lots of people have to travel through the city every day to reach their workplace or their school. Some of them use the time of travelling for reading, studying or even trying to rest. Being forced to listen to someone's conversation because it is so loud, violates their human rights. It should be forbidden to talk on the phone loudly on the means of public transport.
Secondly, it is also very disturbing if a mobile phone rings during a lecture or a seminar at university. Although, it is common knowledge that students should switch off their mobiles when attending a lecture or a seminar, it is not important enough for them. During my university years there were several occasions when someone forgot to switch off his mobile and in the middle of the lesson it started to ring loudly. It was even worse when the person whose phone rang could not find his mobile easily and it continued to ring for several seconds. It should be taken more seriously to switch off one's mobiles before going to a lecture or a seminar.
Finally, when one is involved in an intimate conversation and his mobile rings, the other person may feel very disappointed. It can be interpreted as a lack of respect if one starts talking on the phone with someone else while the original co-converser is waiting for the continuation of the conversation.
Using a mobile can be considered a very good device if one has an appointment and wants to postpone it because of being late. However, it is much likely to be late if one knows that he can send a text message to postpone the appointment. Probably, if one did not have this possibility, one would be more punctual.
In conclusion, there are several occasions in one's life when it is indisputable that mobiles are not used properly. Talking loudly on a means of transport or mobiles ringing during a lecture or seminar can be very disturbing. Moreover, starting to talk to someone else on the phone during a one-to-one conversation or postponing more and more appointments by sending a text message can be a sign of lack of respect.

It is, therefore, only natural that the effect of the so-called technological threat be exaggerated .
Obviously, if we are to avoid the hazard of falling into much extremes we need to find reasonable answers to the following questions: why is this negativistic attitude against technologies taking place ' how can analogical events in the past help us evaluate the present situation; why are not technologies overpowering the human mind; why are people afraid of the technological advent .
If we are to assume that technological progress and human imagination are two irreconcilable things, then we would imminently affiliate ourselves to the Romantic conceptions or even the Luddite attitude. This rage-against-the-machine phenomenon is on a par with primitive myth - making. Moreover, the trends which trigger this kind of attitude can even be traced back to a cheap horror story. Why? The answer here is fear - fear of the unknown. Just like Medusa in the myths of the ancient Greeks, the embodiment of ultimate evil, or even the gruesome monster in Bram Stoner's novel. These two examples both lead us to one and the same conclusion. People tend to generalize their fear in a flat black-and-white image. This also holds true for the stereotypes that have been built up to sum up the three-dimensional technological reality into a distorted one-dimensional concept. And what happens if this image is reduced to a terrifyingly intelligent machine which lurks the infinite paths of the informational highway? From this starting point it is not hard to jump to the conclusion that technologies may impair our mental abilities .
People are afraid of technological progress and claim that this threatens the human faculty. This is ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the primitive aggression of the Luddites on 19th century machinery. They believed that the machines are responsible for unemployment. Others believe that technology threatens to overpower their imagination. Unemployment than was due to mass migration to the cites. Deficiency of thought and lack of imagination is due to entirely personal characteristics .
As it was stated before, people are afraid of the unknown. It isn't hard for the half-informed to see a horrifying image of the near technologically wise future. But to think of a future world where machines are the decision-makers, where humans are reduced to mere walking extensions can hardly be acceptable with no amount of reasonable doubt. The reason why this can hardly be anticipated is the fact that the human mind is irreplaceable. It cannot become the author of its own creation. Whatever marvelous machinery is to be invented in the future, it will always be a byproduct inferior to the capacity of human imagination. What is more, imagination itself is so tightly intermingled with emotions that sometimes no distinct borderline can be drawn between the two. And emotions are often too subtle to be felt, let alone created .
People are sceptical about new technology because they are not equipped with the necessary knowledge to handle it. Being informed helps you avoid potential threats in using any technology, whether it be household appliances or sophisticated virtual reality products. This is analogous to driving a car wit or without a driving permit. Therefore, it is not knowing the rules of these man - made ""tools"" that is the cause for alarm. And a tool is simply a utility. It does not threaten to replace one's imagination. On the contrary, it helps both mind and imagination along the tortuous path of perfection .
Indeed, one must always have a ""luddite"" within him and not take things for granted. This is so, because like any revolution, the technological one has its aftermath. And it can be disasterous if the necessary precautions are not undertaken. But does that mean we have to shut our eyes to the blatant thruth and pretend that technologies do not exist?

For reasons of time or space already, only a few out of all the incoming news can be chosen for publication. A reporter on television has thus to ask himself/herself which passage in a debate for example he/she will show the spectator and with which length. The credibility of television seems to be unshakeable, especially when the pictures are touching us emotionally. But in fact, they are always only a world looked at through the camera of a journalist. That means that nothing is more subjective than the objective of a camera. It is uncontestable that television has the nature of a model of living. Take the tragic incident that happened a few weeks ago, when the two [Illegible word/phrase] .
I once read that an American child, when having left school, has had about 11.000 hours of lessons but 22.000 hours of television with +/- 20.000 murders. I'm persuaded that television exerts an enormous pedagogical influence, unfortunatly no good one in general. But not only children are concerned. Adults also take television as an example for daily life. Take for instance the simple crime series like ""Derrick"" or ""Tatort"" on German television: the inspector is divorced, the families are ruined, the father has a mistress, the mother is drinking, the children are going their own ways. Religion, traditions, conventions only serve the caricature of bourgeois compulsions .
I'm sure that the ""television-family"" really exerts an influence on the domestic everyday life. We simply identify with it. No wonder that divorce and a bit on the side have become trivial offences. Often, I've got the impression that more and more people are living in a manipulated world of dreams and I fear that this is leading to a dulling in the face of reality, to a lack of creativity and that it may ruin the personality. Sure, the media and especially television open us best possibilities for both education and entertainment. Essential is just who decides what we can watch and why. We have to be careful, we have to consume critically so that we can uncover the attempted manipulation. The problem to my view is to cope with the whole host of information we get day in, day out. The danger is that we are virtually thankful that the media are thinking for us. In fact, they propagate what one thinks, feels, does. Here is birth given to the word ""one"" (""man"" in German, ""on"" in French) which replaces individuality by generalization. Curiously enough, those media-makers, who consider themselves as critical, want a new enlightenment. They want us to emancipate from civil constraints, they want us to free ourselves from state, church or traditions. We shall come of age. But today, media and in particular television are becoming a means of remote control of the brain and prevent it from using itself independently. For me, one feature of maturity is actually the ability of independent thinking.

Accordingly, the y regard the present systems of prisons to be outdated and not serving the purpose of improvement of those, who are kept in them. Following this point of view, no civilised society should punish its criminals but rather do its most to rehabilitate them. Unfortunately, this way of thinking, though attractive, is completely wrong. The biggest crime that a society could commit to itself would be to forgive its criminals .
Those who think that we should stop punishing criminals and lead them through the process of reeducation in order to improve their behavior and respect for the law, unavoidably follow the path of thinking established by some nineteenth century philosophers and criminal lawyers. According to this approach, criminals do not commit offenses because they are bad by nature, but rather it is because of the society which forced them to be who they are. How dangerous can accepting this point of view be, may be illustrated by a popular case of a murderer accused in nineteenth century Germany of killing somebody. He said to the court that he was sorry for having committed the crime, but he couldn't be punished, because he had been brought up by the people who regarded crime as something natural and accepted, and therefore the society in general is to be blamed for what had happened. Now we must ask ourselves this question: should we allow killers to get away with a not guilty verdict? Of course not! The judge in the case supported this point of view. He said to the accused that he was sorry, but he, in turn, had been brought up by the people who despised crime and he returned the death sentence verdict .
Society must never stop punishing criminals. It should be realized that punishment, contrary to what some people say, does have a significant purpose to serve. Criminal lawyers, as early as in the Middle Ages, invented the concepts of general and individual prevention. The latter is based on the assumption that if one suffers considerable hardships for his misdemeanour, he will not decide to commit a crime again. The former, on the other hand, presumes that if the general public sees how severe a punishment the convict has received for what he had done, it will not dare to commit the same offense. In other words, it will realize that crime does not pay. Indeed, people must be aware that if they willingly decide to go astray, they will without fail be punished in a severe and quick manner. This is crucial for any society in order to function properly. Rehabilitation, on the other hand, is based on a naive presumption that those who are already bad, will collaborate to improve their behavior. Will any manufacturer lower the prices of his products knowing that he is o monopolist? Will any horse pull a cart without being urged to do it? Obviously not! It is precisely the same case with criminals and rehabilitation .
One should realize, too, that the modern system of prisons is by no means outdated. As a matter of fact, it has never been as lenient as it is nowadays. People who stay behind bars receive decent food, stay warm, may receive regular visits, may write letters and write books, even watch television. Many, on special occasions, are allowed to visit their families outside a prison for a few days. What more should they need? A swimming pool with a swim-up bar and sunglasses? After all, the idea is that they are supposed to endure hardships. One century ago, prisoners could not even dream of such conditions as there are in the prisons today. Water and bread in a dark and damp cell was all they could count for. Today, societies agree to pay great amount of money in order to support comfortable enough prisons, for the people who have done nothing better than to show their disrespect for the law and morality. This fact is rarely mentioned, although it is quite important and should not go without recognition .
What all idealistic points of view have in common is that it is not feasible to put them into practice. It would be simply wonderful to live in a society without prisons and without criminals, either (those few ones who have chanced to put their foot on that land would have already been rehabilitated). Unfortunately, such a state of matters would quickly lead to complete anarchy. We must realize, that prisons are perhaps too comfortable by this time, and the only way to prevent crime is severe sanctions and quick punishment .","The latter is based on the assumption that if one suffers considerable hardships for his misdemeanour, he will not decide to commit a crime again.",C1
389_RUMO4001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"People get used to the achievement of civilisation very quickly. One can hardly imagine a modern apartment without a TVset, a radio or a telephone. Nobody understands how we had been able to live and communicate before these useful things were invented. I wonder if people felt the same when telephone first appeared. It was just a miracle: one didn't need to leave one's house and go somewhere. All one had to do is to take the receiver, to dial the number and to tell anything he or she wanted to convey. I am not against telephone at all, it makes life convenient and comfortable. It makes life easy, but in some sense it separates people, their relationships grow distant. Why to go to see your friends when you can always ring them up. As a result there are so many telephone friends now, when people don't see each other for years but call themselves close friends. I don't think it is a communication in the proper sense, it is just the illusion of it, an ersatz communication, so to speak .
Cinema brought to our life the idea of mass media. As a matter of fact, it doesn't separate people. On the contrary while watching a film one is overwhelmed with the feelings which most of the time are shared by the whole audience. An opinion poll has been conducted recently to find why people go to the cinema. The most common reason was to escape for a moment from this dreary life. Therefore we can say that cinema spreads two great illusions: illusion of living a more interesting and attractive life and illusion of collective or mass consciousness. But still cinema is not so powerful as television because people go to the cinema only occasionally. Television is a much more effective way to influence people's minds. We can say that it combines three features which have been mentioned above: illusion of living a better life, illusion of mass consciousness and illusion of communication. We have surrendered to its power, and now it plays a very important role as the centre of our life. What is the most common thing today? People come home, switch on their tv set and let it work for the rest of the evening. And at weekends, when films go one after another without any pause, they stay at home all day long. Television seems to be a sort of drug which we have grown addicted to. I think it would be useful to try and single out those characteristic features of television which distinguish it from other means of mass media. Unlike radio it appeals to our ability to see and to hear, its visual and aural impact on us is very strong. Unlike cinema which contains a personal attitude and presupposes a personal interpretation, television is neither artistic, nor personal. It uses words to put some idea into our heads depriving us of an opportunity to think in a different way. Therefore it may serve as an excellent means to rule a country as religion used to be, and it was realised in the Third Reich where television was turned into the official means of state propaganda and governmental control .
In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that television as a product of progress brought some good things into our lives but there is hardly any need to mention them because they are familiar to everyone. I wanted to discuss only those negative features of television which may balance the positive ones and help to estimate objectively its role in our life .","In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that television as a product of progress brought some good things into our lives but there is hardly any need to mention them because they are familiar to everyone.",C1
098_DBAN3053.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Many people have a very negative idea of the women's liberation movement and have a lot of prejudices against it. They imagine that feminists are egoistic, ugly, frustrated, lesbian women. And the thought that feminism has done more harm than good to the cause of women often comes to their minds. However, if it hadn't been for some strong women who enchained this emancipation movement, how would have been the women's situation today ? Would we have a right to vote? And what about going to university or having a job ? If we have a look at the feminist movement from its beginning until now, it becomes clear that many positive changes have taken place thanks to feminists. One should also keep in mind that the present feminist movement is not one coherent organisation. There are several groups, all having their own views, own theories and own goals. The media often focalises on the most striking groups, on those feminists who attract attention by their radical actions, actions that are not always approved of by everybody. In this way some people may have a one-sided and negative view on feminism .
in the 19 th Century the first women's organisations arose. During this first period of feminism the women's liberation movement sought equal rights for women, regarding work, education and politics. The marriage articles ( a divorce was almost impossible at the time) and the laws concerning prostitution had to be altered. They also demanded information on contraception and of course a right to vote. In 1870 British wives got the right for property. In 1919 they were allowed to run for Parliament . Not until 1928 they got the right to vote, after a long strife of the suffragettes, Other countries followed this example .
This was just the beginning. In the 1960's a new sort of feminism showed up in the U.S.. A second period of feminism had dawned. From now on the women's liberation movement concentrated more on the women and less on political rights. The idea that women not only have to strife after the granting of equal rights ( women's emancipation but also after the abolition af the behaviour and thinking patterns that discriminated against women ( liberation ) gained more and more interest. These ""new"" feminists wanted to change the prevailing stereotypes of women as weak, passive and dependant individuals who are less rational and more emotional than men. Their goal was to obtain more freedom for women to work and an equal responsability for men and women in the houshold. They criticised the emphasis on women as objects of sexual desire in society. They wanted to broaden the selfawareness of women and the opportunities to the point of equality with men. Also the advancement of women's participation in political decision making and other areas of public life was important .
The U.S. declared 1975 as International Women's Year. Conscious-raising groups, women studies, pubs for women, houses for women, magazines for women ... originated. Things we consider now as self-evident. Still, the women's liberation movement meets a lot of resistance among men as well as women .
The diversity of the movement may cause some problems. All those different groups, all those disagreements and quarrels among feminists often make a bad impression on outsiders. It is difficult to put all these bits and pieces together. And of course not all parts are acceptable. On the other hand, because of the complexity of the women's situation today, it is perhaps not so bad that different groups try to handle tings in their own way. In general you could discern three groups (with fundamental differences): the middle-of-the-road feminists, the socialists and the radical feminists. The first group considers the structure of society as the oppressor of women. The social feminists mean that capitalism is the cause of the inequality. According to the third group, man is the oppressor, so women have to disengage themselves of the male society and they have to create a society of their own .
With this brief sketch of the development of the women's liberation movement and some of its achievements, I think that it is clear that some of the negative opinions on feminists are unfounded. Thanks to the feminist movement the women's place in society has approved. Many things (like the right to vote, magazines for women...) that we now find self-evident, didn't exist two centuries ago. The women's emancipation movement has done some great things but there is still a long way to go. We are unaware of the way in which some of our thoughts confirm the traditional patterns of men and women. The way in which we act and think has a lot to do with messages and examples we get from our birth on, unconscious. And it is difficult to change the unconscious things .",We are unaware of the way in which some of our thoughts confirm the traditional patterns of men and women.,C1
408_SEBG1014.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In today's society where capitalism dictates everything from the way in which we spend our time to our thoughts and feelings it is hard not to become a slave of money. We have to use it in almost every sphere of our life. Even though it can bring us innumerable benefits, it poses a great threat to our well-being and sense of self.
Our lives can be enriched by many experiences and products, such as travel, sports, makeup and more - most of which cannot possibly be attained without the help of money. Since ancient times, people have been using money for trade of their possessions. Instead of giving their goat for a bag of rice, they started using different types of coins - gold, silver or more recently, paper notes. This has enabled them to estimate the exact value of their possessions, thus allowing them to trade more fairly. With the use of money, we can also buy plane tickets and just in a few hours reach the most exotic destinations on our planet, stay in the most luxurious resorts and afford relaxing spas. Money can be often viewed as a well-deserved reward for our hard work. It often enables us to buy appliances and electronic devices which make our life easier, such as computers, mobile phones and washing machines. Having enough money offers you myrriad of choices in life and provides you with a possibility to see the world and get to know people from different cultures and walks of life.
Despite these benefits, there is however the other side of the coin - money often can and does become poisonous. We can see this notion reflected in many parts of our life. Many relationships have been ruined because the people in it could not agree on the division of money between them. Further, people from the upper class are often frowned upon when they decide to date someone from the lower social group. Girls often do not look for real values in potential partners - like honesty, courage and goodness, but instead just search for someone with a big wallet. Money brings about huge gaps within society - the differences between the elite and the poor are sharply defined and walls are not to be crossed. Worst of all, money causes terrifying wars all over the planet and provokes the worst in people - greed and selfishness. Smart children are frequently not given the access to the best education simply because they haven't been born in the rich households. There is also a saying [Quotation] - and it is true, we work more, spend time with our friends and family less just because we have a nonsencial desire to accumulate our possessions. As a result, we get more anxious, tired and bitter. Nature is being destroyed because of the human greed, air is getting more and more polluted - all of it because humans are making factories everywhere, factories that are there to help us accumulate more useless possessions. People have forgotten to love, to rejoice in simple things, to live in accordance to the nature, all because of money.
Even though it is probably impossible to banish money completely, we should all strive to find meaning in other spheres of our lives for the more noble purpuses - such as helping the poor or investing in hospitals or orphanages. In conclusion, although the statement may seem too extreme, money can sometimes indeed be ""the root of all evil"", as the old song has it.","There is also a saying [Quotation] - and it is true, we work more, spend time with our friends and family less just because we have a nonsencial desire to accumulate our possessions.",C1
426_SENS3012.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Does money cause all our problems? It is a very frequently asked question these days, with a plethora of different answers and opinions. Some claim that with money everything is easier; some claim that a piece of paper cannot make your life better. But, one cannot deny, the whole world spins around money.
There are actually two different worlds - the rich one and the poor one. In the world full of money, expensive cars, luxurious mansions, glamour and glitter everything seems to be perfect. Looked from the outside, it really does seem perfect. However, there is much deeper and darker side hidden beneath all that shine. If you look closer into lives of, for example, famous persons, it is not happiness that you see. No. It is dissatisfaction, anger, helplessness. One cannot resist asking ""Why? Why, when they have everything they want?"" Now comes the question of what is really the thing humans want. Cars? Clothes? Expensive hotels? Overloaded bank accounts? People who have all these things do not actually care about them. They are slaves to their fortune. What is the purpose of a huge house if you live there alone? What is the purpose of millions and billions if you have no one to spend them with?
Next are a little less rich people, those who own companies or have well paid jobs so they can afford themselves a luxurious life. Those are people who are never at home, who pay a babysitter to raise their children because they are too busy with earning money. Those are lonely men and women who left their beloved ones or were left by them because they missed every birthday and anniversary, because they were working late. No matter how much money you have, you can never buy time. The true values do not lie in money and in things you can buy with money. Only those who have it know that.
On the other hand, there are people who have so little, almost nothing, speaking materialistically, but actually they have everything. How comes? Well, maybe a mother cannot afford to buy her children the latest phone, but she can spend some time playing with them, she waits them with hot lunch on the table, she is there to kiss them goodnight. Maybe a boyfriend doesn't have money for expensive dinner, but he will make one by himself. Maybe a father cannot buy his son a new car, but he will come to every football mach his son plays. That is the true luxury. It is shame that so many people never realize that, or when they do, it is too late.
Money is an addiction, a sickness. No matter how much you have it, it is never enough, you always want more and more. But it is not money to be blamed. After all, it is nothing more than a piece of paper. The true evil lies in people themselves. Human's greed and envy are the biggest evil force in the world. Money is not alive, it cannot consciously cause you troubles and bring you misery. It is simply a means to an end, and you are the one who decides what that end will be. The best things in life come for free, it has always been like that, and it will always be.",The true evil lies in people themselves.,C1
097_DBAN3050.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Feminism is the political belief that women should have the same rights, power and opportunities that men have. The women's movement wants to improve the situation of women in political, economic, social and cultural respects. In these fields women have always been discriminated against .
Besides historical periods in which the position of women was relatively good, as in ancient Egypt and Rome, there were periods in which their situation was moderate or even bad, as in ancient Greece. During the Renaissance women led a comparitively good life and they were given a freer hand. From then on we see woman's position worsen .
In the eighteenth and nineteenth century the rich woman was forced to stay home doing really nothing, while the lower class woman had to work her fingers to the bone for little money. In this climate the first feminist protest was born .
If we compare the position of a woman in 1994 to that of her nineteenth century counterpart, we can conclude that feminists have already taken quite a step on the long way towards emancipation .
Today the right to vote seems self-evident to us. If women were disfranchised (almost) everybody would scream blue murder. Nevertheless, suffrage for women is a relatively recent phenomenon. In Britain women were given the vote for the first time in 1928 and the Belgian women could enter their votes only after the Second World War. In America, which did not used to be renowned as particularly kind to blacks, black men could go to the polls before white women enjoyed that same right. And countries like Belgium and the United States claimed to be democracies ...
In spite of obtaining suffrage, women's contribution to the political life has stayed strikingly more modest than men's. Yet we can see an evolution in the good direction. More and more political parties try to have an equal number of male and female candidates on their lists. Also the number of elected women seems to be increasing .
Emancipation of women needs more than changing laws. Feminists also react against behaviour patterns that continue the discrimination against women. They try to get rid of the steretoype of the woman as a mother, housewife and sex object .
The ideas of feminism are winning ground. Nowadays a lot of men take responsibility in the upbringing of the children and in the household .
Feminists have done a lot of good to the cause of women. But when I see how women are ' abused ' in publicity for water, soap, aspirins, light products and cars for big fellows, I think there is still a long way to go .","In America, which did not used to be renowned as particularly kind to blacks, black men could go to the polls before white women enjoyed that same right.",C1

It is, therefore, only natural that the effect of the so-called technological threat be exaggerated .
Obviously, if we are to avoid the hazard of falling into much extremes we need to find reasonable answers to the following questions: why is this negativistic attitude against technologies taking place ' how can analogical events in the past help us evaluate the present situation; why are not technologies overpowering the human mind; why are people afraid of the technological advent .
If we are to assume that technological progress and human imagination are two irreconcilable things, then we would imminently affiliate ourselves to the Romantic conceptions or even the Luddite attitude. This rage-against-the-machine phenomenon is on a par with primitive myth - making. Moreover, the trends which trigger this kind of attitude can even be traced back to a cheap horror story. Why? The answer here is fear - fear of the unknown. Just like Medusa in the myths of the ancient Greeks, the embodiment of ultimate evil, or even the gruesome monster in Bram Stoner's novel. These two examples both lead us to one and the same conclusion. People tend to generalize their fear in a flat black-and-white image. This also holds true for the stereotypes that have been built up to sum up the three-dimensional technological reality into a distorted one-dimensional concept. And what happens if this image is reduced to a terrifyingly intelligent machine which lurks the infinite paths of the informational highway? From this starting point it is not hard to jump to the conclusion that technologies may impair our mental abilities .
People are afraid of technological progress and claim that this threatens the human faculty. This is ludicrous, just as ludicrous as the primitive aggression of the Luddites on 19th century machinery. They believed that the machines are responsible for unemployment. Others believe that technology threatens to overpower their imagination. Unemployment than was due to mass migration to the cites. Deficiency of thought and lack of imagination is due to entirely personal characteristics .
As it was stated before, people are afraid of the unknown. It isn't hard for the half-informed to see a horrifying image of the near technologically wise future. But to think of a future world where machines are the decision-makers, where humans are reduced to mere walking extensions can hardly be acceptable with no amount of reasonable doubt. The reason why this can hardly be anticipated is the fact that the human mind is irreplaceable. It cannot become the author of its own creation. Whatever marvelous machinery is to be invented in the future, it will always be a byproduct inferior to the capacity of human imagination. What is more, imagination itself is so tightly intermingled with emotions that sometimes no distinct borderline can be drawn between the two. And emotions are often too subtle to be felt, let alone created .
People are sceptical about new technology because they are not equipped with the necessary knowledge to handle it. Being informed helps you avoid potential threats in using any technology, whether it be household appliances or sophisticated virtual reality products. This is analogous to driving a car wit or without a driving permit. Therefore, it is not knowing the rules of these man - made ""tools"" that is the cause for alarm. And a tool is simply a utility. It does not threaten to replace one's imagination. On the contrary, it helps both mind and imagination along the tortuous path of perfection .
Indeed, one must always have a ""luddite"" within him and not take things for granted. This is so, because like any revolution, the technological one has its aftermath. And it can be disasterous if the necessary precautions are not undertaken. But does that mean we have to shut our eyes to the blatant thruth and pretend that technologies do not exist? Besides, we have many other things to fear.

234_ITRS2034.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"There is not much knowledge about feminism among young women. It is considered a kind of * revolution * of women against men, but it is not simply so .
This social + political movement developed during the last years of the sixties and it believed + aimed that women should have the same rights, power and opportunities as men. However this movement cannot be understood without referring to the situation of society in those years. The late sixties and early seventies were characterized by a deep crisis, which involved, politic, education, social relationships and in this context feminism set up a protest against an old-structured society ruled by men .
Feminism has old and noble origins which trace back to the French revolution. Women at that time claimed the right of being considered an important part of society, asking for civil and political rights .
In Italy during the Risorgimento, the question of feminism was still of little value, but at the end of the 19th century, due to the great number of women working in factories, the * female problem * became very important. Nevertheless what women really claimed was not only the right of working in good conditions, but they aimed at the emancipation of women as a movement of renewal of the heart of society. However women had to wait until 1945 to obtain an important success, indeed in that year they gained the right to vote. From 1945 italian population, like many others in Europe, was * busy * in * starting again *, there was a lot to do in a country destroyed by the war. This period sees the rise of the middle-class, and witnessed the so called economic * boom *. This well established middle-class still didn't give women the same opportunities as men, so in the seventies due to the ferments developed feminism broke out .
In those years women expressed their anger showing a strong rebellious aspect. They stood up for their rights in a society which didn't give them the same chances as men. They fought against male power, thus trying to destroy his role in society. They were against the old structured society where women could be mainly housewife, whereas man could study, work and chose with freedom. Unfortunately their noble ideas degenerated into a sort of extremism which spoiled their ideals, thus reducing, in some situations, their insurrection in a sterile fight between man + women for who had the duty to do the washing up, or the houseworks in the family .
In my opinion feminism was an important movement that marked a necessary break in Italian society. Thanks to those fights, now there are women free to dedicate themselves to successful careers in management, politics, science, before denied .
However these glorious conquests are only one aspect of the results obtained. The new and imposing role of women created a lack of balance in our society. Families are more and more abandoned by women interested in working many hours a day. Children are no longer educated by their mothers, but by baby-sitter, grand-parents or nursery-schools. The family isn't a strong institution any longer, and the consequences are a lack of values. Many sociologists claim that the weakening of the family and the consequent weakening of familiar bounds, are the main sources of many problems that distress our society .
So as I have analyzed the subject is controversial, because to some important conquests correspond some failures. I don't consider myself a feminist because I don't agree with the extremism they reached; but I believe that it was necessary to reach a certain freedom of choice and also to develop a certain self-consciousness which are the most important elements to be aware of our limits and our potentialities as human being .","Nevertheless what women really claimed was not only the right of working in good conditions, but they aimed at the emancipation of women as a movement of renewal of the heart of society.",C1

But on reflection, I consider that we should be cautious about making over-simplified assertions and try to consider the emancipation issue from a more prismatic point of view, which is not an easy undertaking .
According to [Reference] emancipation is [Quotation] . The notion of emancipation implies that of equality and, considered under that angle, we are far away from the emancipated human being the Western world claims as one of its great achievements. In my opinion, it would be wrong to denigrate the enormous task accomplished by feminists such as, for example, the British suffragettes. Who could forget that in the 19th century many male citizens were legally allowed to beat their wife, that women were not admitted to universities or that they were denied the right to vote?
But in the following lines, I will try to give a quick outline of what I consider as being important aspects of the emancipation issue .
As I see it, the question of emancipation is at its very essence an economic one. Women now have the opportunity to work outside their home which means that they can earn their own living and no longer depend economically on their husband .
Some may argue that women now have a lot more to do than in earlier days, that they must try to combine the work outside with that inside their home. But if a woman's partner does not help her with the ""homework"", she now has the choice either to die in harness or to revolt and possibly leave him. But many so-called ""liberated"" women abuse of their power and it is a shame that they seem to think that now it is their turn to oppress others .
In many areas of life, our social and financial situation determinates the way in which we will be treated. Let us only take the example of medecine and law: the most competent medical specialists and lawyers are often reserved to the rich. But not only the financial situation may be an obstacle in a person's life: in our bureaucratic society, where law is supposed to be accessible to all, you need a certain educational background in order to manage to obtain what is considered to be your rights .
What are the most important rights a society should offer to its population? In my view, the right to work is one of them. A job gives you financial independence and the sense to contribute towards a function of our society which could be satisfactory for all its members .
It is a pity that more and more people fear for their job or find themselves shunted to one side. In order to safe money many jobs are sacrified, which in the long run will only amplify our problematic situation .
These reflections lead me to consider our political world. Are we equal politically?
No, we are not. The best proof of this affirmation is the fact that we are ruled by people who benefit from the regime of parliamentary privilege and enjoy many other extra advantages. Our politicians seldom remain loyal and honest once they are in power, and their politics are very often far away from the real needs of the community .
The gap between the most and the least favoured classes is widening, and it is tragic that those who rule us belong most often to the favoured classes or have to deny their original ideas if they want to survive in the political world. Those people, even if they are elected by our democratic system (which is far from being perfect) are simply out of touch with the problems faced by less fortunate members of our society .
Moving towards an increasingly egocentric society with growing unemployment, racism, juvenile criminality and drug-abuses the crucial issue is that of the achievement of a real emancipation for every human being, whatever his or her gender, age or social and cultural background .","In order to safe money many jobs are sacrified, which in the long run will only amplify our problematic situation .",C1

Money is generally regarded as a priceless key to unlock the slammed-shut doors which one encounters in daily life. Hence there is nothing that materialistic people would not be willing to do to obtain it. There exist positive means of earning money; working with endurance, integrity and good motivation seem to be the most worthy. Nevertheless exist other means of obtaining it which are not so honorable, but quicker. These means have become prominent in present day society .
These days society is evidently led by tendencies of consumption unknown before. During the Roman Empire, the Middle Ages and The lndustrial Revolution for instance, the boundaries between classes were completly separated and only a few fortunate members of the groups in power were aware of and could enjoy the delights wealthiness could provide. Today the means of communication transmit the excelencies of a glamorous world to those who find it hard to make ends meet. Hence the phrases ' I own"", ' I possess"" are becoming the guiding lights of a broad sector of society .
It is an unknown fact that to own and to posses one has to buy and that requires money. How does one find money? It is precisely at this point that evil is likely to make its apperance onto the stage especially because the cycle of money dictates that when money enters the hands of one it leaves the pocket of another. The trick is how to convince others to let loose their pockets. Even with in the limits of the legal methods of finding money there exist hidden tactics to seize the money of others. For instance, marketing is a means of making a piece of merchandise look wonderful and absolutely necessary for our existence, when the truth is the contrary. Are these methods of using propaganda in adverdsing to sell at all cost absolutely legal?.
However publicity and marketing are minor ""crimes"" when compared to violence, death, war, deprivation of human rights and other horrors which are aimed at the attainment of money, it seems that the value of human life diminishes as the value of money increases. It is then that homo lupu homini est may be applied to the definition of human behaviour. At this disgraceful view of human nature, man's blood stained hands rise proudly showing their ignominious award .
Nonetheless, it may be adduced that not always behind a violent act is an uncontainable lust for the acquisition of money or power. It may be alleged that nonmaterialistic ideological motives can prompt persons to get engaged in actions which endanger other people's basic rights even that of life. However, how many of those people do not conduct themselves by an ideal, but are subtly manipulated by the desires to accomplish the aims of an economical gain?.
In spite of all the vile acts and corruption which surround the world of money, it would be unfair not to acknowledge the altruistic purposes which lead some individuals or organisations to put their or other's money at the service of the needy ones .
These non-profit organisations are the most outstanding proof of the praisable actions which can be carried out thanks to money. Money can help to mitigate manu disabilities, calamities and much suffering where its lack is source of a continuous state of misfortune and afliction .
In conclusion, it must be taken into consideration that although the allure of money compells human beings to do wrong beyond any limits, in the long term money is neither good or bad itself but persons and their actions determine the role money play in the world .","Nevertheless exist other means of obtaining it which are not so honorable, but quicker.",C1
194_HUEL4059.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The technology of mobile phones has developed greatly in the last fifteen years. The improvement is still continuing and the use of these objects has spread like wildfire. By now almost everybody owns a cellphone. It can be seen in the hands of tiny school children as well as in their grandparents! Of course, mobiles have disadvantages too. Some doctors claim that the radiation of the electromagnetic waves these phone work with may cause heart attack. What is even more threatening, is how mobiles effect people's daily life. Privacy is seriously endangered by the constant presence of cellphones.
On one hand, companies are to blame. Managers very often demand non-stop accessibility from their employees. This means that workers have to take their mobiles home and they are not allowed to switch them off even at night. This is not only disturbing the employee but his or her family as well. If the person is called at night, the ringing wakes up at least his/her partner or, in worse case, the children as well.
Companies are not taking into consideration that their employees have a life outside the office, which should not be so. People should be allowed to switch off their phones at least in the night hours.
On the other hand, mobile users create the problems themselves, even if unconsciously. Many people are addicted to their mobiles and they are not aware how this might affect others in their environments. By owning the mobile some people gain the - sometimes fake - feeling of importance. Since they cannot bear missing a call or a text message, these people carry their phones along with them everywhere - even to the toilet. This is a wrong attitude. They should realize that not looking at their cellphones every second will certainly not result in catastrophe.
But even very important persons (doctors, for instance) should think about the people around them, when they are making or receiving calls or messages. Often they rudely answer unimportant calls in the middle of a conversation or a consultation. This immediately makes the partner or patient feel bad, because it gives them a feeling that their speech is not as valuable and worth continuing as the phone call. Most likely nobody would appreciate it if a third person came and interrupted their discussion. Private calls at working time should be thought of the same way.
To sum up, mobile phones mean an increasing threat to people's private life. Be it the company or the owners of phones themselves who decide not to switch the mobile off, the constant use of cellphones might harm one or more people's intimacy and privacy. This is an unhealthy situation and people should realize that sometimes instead of paying attention to the mobile they should pay more attention to their environment.",The improvement is still continuing and the use of these objects has spread like wildfire.,C1
315_MDCM2040.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In the past, religion was the force that controlled people's lives, thoughts, customs. They obeyed every rule and were convinced that the church has the ultimate power over them. People were blinded, and the church dominated their lives. The church, for example in medieval times, had great wealth, political power and influence over community life, art, architecture and education. The middle ages are quite often called the Age of Faith because religion was so pervasive in European society. All in all, in medieval times people didn't see things reasonably and were quite blinded. As Karl Marx put it: [Quotation] [Reference] . However, that stays in the past and another opium for the masses was discovered - television. Television replaced the religion, but it has quite the same purpose - to make masses subordinate and believe In what they see on TV.
	To begin with, television is a medium that is intended for large audience recipients. People around the world are constantly in touch with the presence of the mass media. What is more, every child nowadays is born with computer and television next to it. We are totally occupied by the new technologies and new electronic gadgets, and eventually we can't think with our brains as the time comes, we would start believing in what we see, which is not always right, according to the eminent scientist that grasp this concept in their studies.
	Secondly, mass media, including radio, TV and newspapers, have huge influence in determining and shaping people's ideas. I personally think that mass media controls our mind simply because of the commercials, the movies, and songs we see every day. If you see a beautiful girl with nice clothes and wel shaped body, you would like to have that dress and her body! Some experts claim that hidden subliminal psychology is being used in the modern media industry to achieve the desired results with their video materials. These have changed our lives to a great degree. First, they affect peoples' views on fashion. We wear clothes that may look like what famous actors or singers had on recently. What we watch on TV, radio, what we read in newspaper and magazines affect us in a great amount. When choosing what to wear, most of us have a tendency to choose what is said or shown to be fashionable by famous people. Furthermore, it is evident that the mass media also plays an important part in our attitude towards life in general. Some people complain that the young people today tend to be more lazier and more violent and aggressive and feel they need gadgets as much as possible. This is simply the result of bad programs shown on TV all the time, websites with no control whatsoever and even the parents' carelessness. Some parents allow their children to surf the web, without noticing that on Internet there are challenges which the young have little experience how to deal with them. People, especially young adults, always have an idol and they tend to imittate what their idols do no matter if these things are good and desirable or bad.
	Thirdly, the saddest thing that happens while we watch TV is that we become more and more subordinate, we believe in what we see and we don't develop the critical thinking. As Bill Hicks put it: [Quotation] What is more, studies suggest watching television for longer periods changes the very structure of a child's brain and decreases their verbal abilities. Even much worse effects could possibly exist: although a cause-and-effect connection is hard to prove, higher rates of obesity, antisocial behavior and mental health problems are in correlation with the hours spent in front of the TV.
	To conclude, mass media (TV) is a powerful tool used to manipulate the masses by the ruling class. It defines what is normal and acceptable and shapes people's opinions and attitudes. What is not presented on the TV channels is regarded as unimportant. There are numerous events and things that happen in the world, but if TV companies don't think masses should see that, they don't broadcast that. Television definitely controls the masses, however it is our right to choose whether to watch it or not.",We wear clothes that may look like what famous actors or singers had on recently.,C1

 The times have changed and the church has lost its power, but it didn't took very long for the society to find a new god to worship - it is the almighty silver screen. The magical box which emits pictures and sounds has long become a device which is an absolute must for every household. Just think about it - you go to your new neighbor's house to welcome him into the community and suddenly you notice one fatal flaw in his living room - on the cupboard where usually a television stands a potted plant. The first things that would pop into your head would be that he's either too poor to own a device which has become mandatory in every house or that he's plain weird. But in this case it isn't the neighbor who is the weird one, but you .
 Opinion polls say that in the past three decades watching television has become one of the most popular ways of passing ones free time. People do not read books that much anymore or spend long winter evenings socializing with each other. Now they got the ultimate time waster - television. Just with one press of a button on your remote control and you are already engulfed with entertainment. If your life lacks romance - switch on the soaps and you will be entangled in more love affairs than you can handle. If you need to add some extra realism into your daily routine - follow dozens of reality shows which are as real as a Loch ness monster. Nobody can withstand the ""greatness"" that is television .
 But I think that the entertainment comes at the high price. First of all, those who spend most of their time in front of the silver screen tend to have back problems from constantly sitting or lying in an unhealthy manner. Secondly, if you spend too much time watching TV, and furthermore if you do it in a dark, poorly lit room you soon may need to visit your eye doctor and get some glasses. Furthermore, doing nothing else and watching already given images deprives ones imagination and ability to fantasize, though this can be avoided if the from time to time spends some time with a book. And finally, some people, especially little children can get heavily addicted to it and start forgetting their own duties so they could spend more time with ""the magic box"".
 In conclusion, while TV isn't really bad itself, people started abusing it and depending on it way to much. There is no sin in watching the news, catching your favorite TV show or some movie from time to time, but when people start spending more than half of their free time lying around and letting the television do the thinking for theirselves, that is really sad .","And finally, some people, especially little children can get heavily addicted to it and start forgetting their own duties so they could spend more time with ""the magic box"".",C1
426_SENS3012.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Does money cause all our problems? It is a very frequently asked question these days, with a plethora of different answers and opinions. Some claim that with money everything is easier; some claim that a piece of paper cannot make your life better. But, one cannot deny, the whole world spins around money.
There are actually two different worlds - the rich one and the poor one. In the world full of money, expensive cars, luxurious mansions, glamour and glitter everything seems to be perfect. Looked from the outside, it really does seem perfect. However, there is much deeper and darker side hidden beneath all that shine. If you look closer into lives of, for example, famous persons, it is not happiness that you see. No. It is dissatisfaction, anger, helplessness. One cannot resist asking ""Why? Why, when they have everything they want?"" Now comes the question of what is really the thing humans want. Cars? Clothes? Expensive hotels? Overloaded bank accounts? People who have all these things do not actually care about them. They are slaves to their fortune. What is the purpose of a huge house if you live there alone? What is the purpose of millions and billions if you have no one to spend them with?
Next are a little less rich people, those who own companies or have well paid jobs so they can afford themselves a luxurious life. Those are people who are never at home, who pay a babysitter to raise their children because they are too busy with earning money. Those are lonely men and women who left their beloved ones or were left by them because they missed every birthday and anniversary, because they were working late. No matter how much money you have, you can never buy time. The true values do not lie in money and in things you can buy with money. Only those who have it know that.
On the other hand, there are people who have so little, almost nothing, speaking materialistically, but actually they have everything. How comes? Well, maybe a mother cannot afford to buy her children the latest phone, but she can spend some time playing with them, she waits them with hot lunch on the table, she is there to kiss them goodnight. Maybe a boyfriend doesn't have money for expensive dinner, but he will make one by himself. Maybe a father cannot buy his son a new car, but he will come to every football mach his son plays. That is the true luxury. It is shame that so many people never realize that, or when they do, it is too late.
Money is an addiction, a sickness. No matter how much you have it, it is never enough, you always want more and more. But it is not money to be blamed. After all, it is nothing more than a piece of paper. The true evil lies in people themselves. Human's greed and envy are the biggest evil force in the world. Money is not alive, it cannot consciously cause you troubles and bring you misery. It is simply a means to an end, and you are the one who decides what that end will be.

327_NOAC1008.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"When a person commits a crime, he or she should be punished for it. That is at least how most people feel. It seems morally right that the criminal should pay for his actions. Knowing that the criminal will go to prison, secluded from the rest of the world, his freedom and personal life being robbed from him, satisfies society. They get even with him. But does it benefit society in the long run?
Ideally, the criminal would come out of prison as a new and improved person. He will have had time to do some serious thinking about his life and his wrongdoings, and will have been determined to live a better life .
Of course, his is rarely the case. The prison often hardens the criminal, and once the person is free, he will most likely return to living the same lifestyle .
Although the prison has served as a punishment for the criminal, it has also wasted much of the taxpayer's money .
If on the other hand, the criminal goes through some sort of rehabilitation, it would profit both the criminal and the society, given that the criminal is going to be able to live a more productive life once he is free .
Obviously, if the criminal is suffering from a poor mental state, psychiatric help should be given. But at the same time many prisons today teaches the prisoners some type of skill, for instance activities like pottery making, but also different job skills. While it keeps the prisoners occupied when they are locked up, it is also a great help for them when they are released. It should be easier for them to function normally in society, and thus stay away from crime .
In my opinion, a criminal should be punished, as well as being rehabilitated. It is important to set an example to show that society does not tolerate criminal offenses. In addition serving as a punishment for the criminal, prison also keeps them away from society, out of harms way .
While rehabilitation of all criminals would benefit society, it is not realistic. Not every one wants to be helped, and not every one can be helped .
What prison should not be though, but often is today, is a school for the prisoners on how to be a better criminal. This only punishes society .","He will have had time to do some serious thinking about his life and his wrongdoings, and will have been determined to live a better life .",C1
448_SWUL1003.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The world of today is basically demythologized, still quite a few people are interested in myths because the myths have a message for them. As a matter of fact they are stories about rules of living. What we learn in our schools today are not words of wisdom. We learn technology, we get information. Our world seems to have been drained of spiritual values. People feel powerless. That is precisely what I believe is modern society's curse, this powerlessness, the weariness people feel, the alienation from the world that they live in. A social stagnation with artificial life and false life span, which has taken over. Maybe we need a hero that will give expression to our deepest yearnings .
Does society need heroes? Yes, I think so. Because needs images that will keep all the disrupted tendencies together and gather them into a purpose. The myths help us to realize that there is a possibility to achieve completion, to be able to use all our strength and to bring joy into the world. To kill the monsters and the fire-spitting dragons is to defeat darkness .
What happens then, if society does not have any powerfull mythology anymore? Our teenagers loose faith in the religions in which they have been raised and turn inward. They often do this with the sopport of drugs. Society has not assigned any rituals that will make them members of the tribe and the community. This is the essential meaning of the initiation ceremonies. In primitive societies they strike out teeth, inscribe scars on their bodies and practise circumcision etc .
In modern cities like New York for example teenagers create their own rites. That is why there is graffitti all over the city. They have their own gangs, their own initiation rites, and their own laws. But they are dangerous, because their laws are not the laws of the city. They have not een taken up in the society .
Is modern society so devoid of hope then? I do not think it has to be that way. In our technological society where most of our dreams and fantasies are represented in films and videogames, there is a growing tendency to create new factasies of our own. People are getting tired of having everything served on a silver plate. We need to create new myths and at the same time to look back in search for old lost ones .
In the myth, there is no argument against industry and science. When you plunge into a totally unknown adventure and make a path, Wheater it is some sort of technological breakthrough or simply a new way of living, you run the risk of getting too enthusiastic or to neglect certain mechanical aspects then you will most certainly fail. When assenting to one's longings, enthusiasm, and feelings you have to keep your head cool, so that it will not lead you straight into calamity. I cannot recognize any opposition between science and mythology. Science itself is now drawing nearer the dimensions of mystery, soon it will have reached the border. The border between that which can be understood and that which will never be clear, because it is a mystery that is beyond the reach of human reseach. For instance; we do not even know what a nucleus is, if it is a wave or a particle - maybe it is both .
What kind of myths will incorporate the machine into our new world? The cars are already there in mythology that is. They are in our dreams. Airplanes too, play an important role in the service of imagination. The voyage of the airplane represents the liberation from earth, in a way pretty much like birds symbolizing freedom. And now it is also time for the computor to introduce itself in the world of fantasy. The computor that many people regard as omnipotent god, with its software going in and out of it, as if they were angels bringing information from earth .
Not only do I believe that there is a place for imagination in our technological society, but furthermore I am quite convinced that it is neccesary for us and future generations to keep on dreaming. Really one of the most important differences between machines and humans, is that humans are capable of imagining things, while a machine is directed by certain signals and commands. In order to be master and inventor of our technological devices, we must continue doing what humans have done for several thousands of years - that of dreaming and imagining .","Airplanes too, play an important role in the service of imagination.",C1
110_FIHE1022.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"This is a claim that is often being made, especially by people who criticize the university system. I agree that university degrees are theoretical, but I think that it does not necessarily mean that they would be of little value in real life. Quite the contrary. I would like to argue that the concentration of theory is actually very useful and valuable, both for the individual and the society in general .
The way I see it, the less theoretical education, say, for example, vocational education, is no more successful in preparing students for ""the real life"" than the more theoretical university education is. The vocational training typically tells the student exactly what to do and how. It gives ready made solutions to problems, so the student who has completed vocational education has not usually learned how to deal with unexpected problems or situations. And as we know things seldom work out the way one expects, and we often find ourselves facing an unexpected problem. The university education, on the other hand, prepares students especially for these unexpected situations. University education encourages students to personal interpretation of situations and individual problem solving. It familiarizes students with different methods and theories, different perspectives and ways of solving problems. It demands the students to be more independent and requires more creativity from the students themselves, than the less theoretical education, and I see these abilities as very important in the real life .
The claim often goes that the vocational education is much better because it prepares students for their specific professions. Some things a university degree might not be able to give us. These might include such routine skills as correct telephone conduct, or how to repair a copy machine, that are needed in most jobs today. Instead of these mechanical skills the university education gives us something much more useful; it enhances our mental capacities and develops our creative problem solving abilities. And is thus, in my opinion, much more useful in the long run. When talking about employment we must also take into consideration the fact university degree is usually a requirement for the top posts, in which case university education is very useful indeed .
In addition to the benefits that university education has in securing high level employment, we must also look at its value to the individual in his private life. The university teaches us to understand various spectra of life more fully, whereas vocational education seldom has opportunities for this. The Finnish university degree in particular gives us both all-round education, and a deeper and more detailed understanding of one or two fields. When we study at university level we learn the know-how of collecting information, processing and analysing it. We learn how to theorize, and how to perceive larger structures behind the fractured information that is being poured to us. We are able to examine information critically, to question things and not accept them at face value. A person who has gone through the vocational education system does not have these tools at his use. Therefore he may sometimes feel that he the real life does not make any sense to him, and feelings of alienation might result from this .
A further example of how university education prepares us for the real life, and how it is beneficial, is the fact that educated people tend to be more active in the society, by belonging to different organisations and voting actively. Due to their educational background these individuals realise their potential of making their voice heard, and that they really can influence decision making in the society. So university education is actually very valuable from the society's point of view as well, and not merely from the individual's .",The vocational training typically tells the student exactly what to do and how.,C2
096_DBAN3042.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"It has been said before that money is the root of all evil. Surely not all evil is due to money, but the far-reaching harm that is being done to individuals in our world has to be attributed to capitalism. The system has undoubtedly influenced human behaviour at the end of this millennium: capitalism has added greatly to the all encompassing paralysis of the world. This essay focuses not only on the influence of capitalism on the individual, but also on the artist and on art itself .
In the closing years of the 20th century the individual person finds himself surrounded by unnecessary misery and gross inequality. Our community does not take the individuals integrity into account. According to Ludien Goldman, a famous literary critic, it was the so-called new look capitalism that killed the intrinsic value of the individual. When at the beginning of this century the capital concentrated itself around a select number of entrepreneurs, the free trade turned into an economy of monopolies and trusts. In this new economic sustem, the individual had lost its central position. Unlike the 19th century liberalism, the new look capitalism did not allow individuals to take part in big business. As a result, passivity grew .
Consumption is one of the key-words in the capitalists dictionary. People are urged in various ways to buy products that can improve their standard of living, so that after a while those redundant products become indispensable. Riches alone make no man happy, although we live in a world in which wealth seems to be the initial goal of life. Consequently, a lot of people are blinded by the considerations of career and personal profit .
Now how does capitalism affect the artist? The artist, too, is an individual and for that reason has to be protected. He must be given full spatio-temporal freedom to exploit his creativity and genius in order to produce Art. The artist must keep his independency, although he is still part of a society - whether he likes it or not. This society however may not prevent him from expressing his thoughts freely and making hiw own choices .
Theoretically, capitalism gives people this freedom to choose. I have to disagree with this definition. This is the kind of statement that implies that the homeless in e.g. New York City are somehow being homeless of their own volition. In the capitalist system, if you have no money, you have no choice, and capitalism defines freedom as choice .
To conclude this short essay, I'll briefly touch upon the capitalist view of the relationship between art and commerce. I will not discuss the contents of Art. The central simplicity of capitalism is that if something makes a profit then it must be good. This kind of reasoning may do when we talk about hamburgers, or refrigerators, but not when we discuss art. Hundreds of books have been written on the criterions for art, but it is sure that sales potential can never be the sole criterion for art. Therefore I say that capitalism is threatening Art .",Now how does capitalism affect the artist?,C2

This opinion however can be criticized on several grounds .
Although it is true that most university degrees are theoretical, it does not mean that they do not prepare students for the ""real world"", or professional world where they will have to put what they have learned into practice. A
chemist who has just recently graduated from college will probably take more time to make a pharmaceutical preparation than a practically trained lab technician, but after a time, when he has gained experience, he will be as good as him, and what is more, he will be able to understand what he is doing, being able to detect possible mistakes made by the general practitioner. Furthermore, he will always have a kind of overview on whatever he will do, which the technician, trapped in his mechanical routine, will never have. We here find an illustration of one of the university graduate's major assets: his critical sense. His theoretical studies must have given him the tools to think for himself and not to accept everything he is told without further analysis .
University studies also form students to be methodical and organized. they must be able to see at once what is important in each of the different subjects their curriculum includes, and to assimilate it in such a way that they will be able to render it at the exam, showing they have understood it. This will provide them with an analytical spirit, another great asset in their future life, when they will be confronted with entirely new situations for which they will have to find straightforward solutions .
Next to those qualities, university also gives students the opportunity to meet people from various backgrounds: geographical, social, intellectual, ... and they should make the most of it, talking and exchanging ideas, trying to understand other mentalities, learning to respect people who are different from them. Various programs even give students the chance to go abroad, and this probably is the best preparation for the ""real"" world. Their degree will indeed give them the skills necessary for their future profession, even if they first need some time to adapt to its practice, but they will have gained something more essential from their contacts with other people: an open mindedness which will make them aware that their professional or familial world is but a small part of a much larger one, which might rightly be called ""the real world.""","Furthermore, he will always have a kind of overview on whatever he will do, which the technician, trapped in his mechanical routine, will never have.",C2
311_MDCM2032.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Education is one of the main sources in every person's intellectual development, affecting our lives in one way or another. Moreover, it still remains as a silent issue of discussion with less or no effort done to understand our educational system and the presenting of knowledge to young and imaginative human minds. In comparison to the past, more and more of the young people decide to dedicate themselves to their studies and intellectual improvement, believing that the money and the effort put in it will be of great importance in their future life as young educated individuals. The main issue which is going to be discussed further on is whether the university degrees are of real value, and whether they prepare people for the real world.
	To begin with, all of us are aware of the purpose of the university studies. What the real question is, whether the studies succeed in realizing the purpose. The university students are forced to memorize information, but what they really need in order to be prepared for the real world is personal growth training, financial management training, communication training, emotional intelligence training, and healthy living training. Some people believe that the university is not place where life skills should be learned, but rather an educational institution which prepares students for job-careers. The problem is that statistics show that 53.6% of college graduates, under the age of 25, are out of work or underemployed, which is yet another thing to bear in mind when thinking of the real value of the university degree.
	David Ellis in his article for ""The Telegraph"" discusses the way universities teach students to fail in ""real life"". [Quotation] [Reference] He says that a degree is nothing more but a proof that you wanted to learn, can learn and will keep learning. It shows your mind has been [Quotation] [Reference] . What he tries to say is that the university degree is simply not enough. People make mistakes by encouraging too many students into university, and at the same time forcing them to believe that the purpose of the university is entirely professionally oriented.
	The previous article goes hand in hand with Aliezah Hulett TED-Ed Club talk on the topic ""Preparing Students for the Real World"". She raises questions as: ""Are teenagers today prepared for life after school?"" The school system and parents should be working together to raise educated students. Schools should be accountable for instructing students to be knowledgeable about the world around them. It should be a joint effort between parent and educator to train the next generation of children to be independent and prepared for the real life. One of the topics discussed is whether university student would be able to handle the sense of responsibility and maturity that comes from having a job. When someone puts their head down to achieve their goals by themselves, as an independent adult, their outcome will reflect what they learned in both college and ""real life school"". Similarly the Northeastern University economists Paul E. Harrington and Andrew M. Sum argue the most pressing problem facing the university graduates today: overeducation on one hand and malemployment on the other. The reality is that more and more college graduates are stuck in low wage and low skilled jobs . [Quotation] [Reference] Also, this article contains an example of a certain graduate student S.F. who got a degree in Network and information-technology administration, and after he couldn't find a job, the Eastern Michigan University gave him a job as a custodian in the student center. This very example makes us consider the value of the university degree and ask ourselves whether the degree is really needed in order to become successful and financially stable in the future or it is just a way to manipulate the hard working students and make business based on their effort and hard work.
	All in all, the university degree is not an infallible way for safe and great career as many people consider. When students enter the real world, besides the knowledge gained from education, they need wisdom and specific skills that are not offered in our educational system. Therefore the universities do not produce real-life prepared students and the university degree is not valuable in a way of guaranteed job or career opportunity. The world demands people who can think creatively and differently, take opportunities to compromise their true dreams and hopes, and grow a personality by breaking the boundaries of the everyday teaching.",Similarly the Northeastern University economists Paul E.,C2

A good example to illustrate this statement could be politics nowadays. Wealthy countries dominate the poor ones; even though slavery and colonialism are far behind, we still see that oppression is happening in a subtle way. For example, Africa's natural recources are widely exploited by more powerful countries; sometimes even wars emerge whose true cause are those resoruces - but this is only one thing people do in order to gain more money. We hear statements promoting equality of all people every day, but those are only words; in real life, the situation is quite the opposite. Also, the taxes people pay to their countries should be collected for public expenses, but many politicians neglect citizens' welfare and secretly spend the money for their own needs.
Children and teenagers also face different situations proving that not all people are equal. In schools, the only important thing for pupils has become to look good, have expensive clothes, smartphones and even expensive cars in some cases. The worst thing about that is that a great many parents encourage this in a way and spend a lot of money on their children. It is surprising that even some teachers prefer rich pupils to those who are not equally wealthy. Those who can't afford expensive things are rejected and looked upon as people who don't deserve the same treatment like others. They often have to try much harder, and even in that case success is not guaranteed.
More importantly, in a society where capitalism dominates, workers don't have the rights they should have - they are not paid enough, they perform many jobs simultaneously and they often work longer than they should. An employee in a coffee shop often has to serve thy guests, clean and do any other work necessary. This is another way for more powerful people to make fortune by using others' abilities and hard work. The law is also corrupted and it doesn't protect those people who are forced to work in those harsh conditions in order to make a living. Not only do they have to work hard, but they are not treated equally when they try to get a job - we often hear that somebody had paid a specific sum of money or that they are employer's cousins and were employed owing to these facts.
However, in the last few decades there have been considerable changes concerning women and ethnic minorities, for example. In the past centuries, women had barely any rights; they were not allowed to vote during elections and were not paid as highly as men. That is all in the past now and the situation concerning the equality of sexes is getting better. Also, some ethnic groups were discriminated by the society until recently, but now this is changed and these people can claim their rights as well. Also, some political associations such as the United Nations help to promote human rights and assistance between countries.
Many organizations have been founded recently whose goal is to help poor people and there are always new campaigns promoting human rights and equality of all people. Many people are willing to help and they often donate money and other necessary things useful for those who need help, not taking their race or nationality into consideration. For example, the Red Cross is an international organization whose aim is the benefit of old, sick and poor people from around the world.
To sum up, equality is certainly promoted in the society, but it is controversial and also raises questions about how true this is in real life. Even through media, we are faced with numerous prejudices and attitudes that show us that some men truly are more equal than others. Unfortunately, all these prejudices are mostly based on money as an indication of how valuable people are.","We hear statements promoting equality of all people every day, but those are only words; in real life, the situation is quite the opposite.",C2
325_MDCM3065.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"If one characterizes this century as relying only on reason it is easy to extract imagination and the dreams from the centre and instead leave room for a different era that is the era of science, technology and industrialization which many people believe has deprived young people of any imagination and dreams. One is to believe that success is achieved through measuring the achievement in all the above spheres. However, it does not have to be so if one takes into consideration how these three spheres are interpersonally connected to imagination and dreams. This essay will further scrutinize how each three: science, technology and industrialization, are somewhere connected with imagination and dreams .
	If we take Imagination and science one can clearly see that they are seemingly unrelated. Imagination is taken as being the mere expression of a free thought whilst science is unyielding and rigorous. Science is bounded to fall within the understandable and reachable, in contrary imagination is without any boundaries. Both may seem completely different but what most people cannot see is that they are somewhat connected. One similarity that comes to mind is the balance between the two forces that are struggling tenaciously to achieve something of thought. There is a type of mutual relationship between these two opposites. Namely, science needs imagination to thrive, whilst imagination needs some sort of scientific support to function. If one takes scientists as being people strictly following rules and laws we must also engage with the thought that they also need imagination in the creative process. Also, imagists need to rely on science, if not they will fall in utter chaos. Consequently, imagination seems to be present even with parallel existence of science .
	The question we should be asking here is ""what is technology without the imagination part?"" What I am trying to imply here is that, technology is not just the invention of GPS, gadgets and telephones; it is the process that allows our imagination to transpire into the real world. An author enthusiastic about this theme holds that [Quotation] . To prove that, let me take you to Dick Tracy's cartoons where the wrist watch was also a walkie-talkie which has now become reality incorporated in our smart phones. It is a perfect example of imagination brought to the fore and creating something that we nowadays call a technology process. Take this citation for example [Quotation] . So to conclude, imagination is not lost here either, it is just how we perceive things .
	Industrialization can also be seen as interchangeable with imagination. If we take Slater's spinning machine which he produced from memory, the evidence is clear how imagination played a big role in this industrialization part. Another example are the railroads thanks to which transport of goods and people went swiftly and quickly. Let us take into consideration the imagination of an author such as Charles Dickens and his novel Hard Times. He put the question of industrial society as a subject to what might be entitled as the mobilization of imagination. Thus, proving once again how imagination can be put into practice to elaborate on the theme of industrialization .
	To conclude, science, technology and industrialization have all something in common. Namely, they all emerge from one single force that is our imagination. Maria Montessori stated that [Quotation] . In other words, imagination is the starting point which leads to scientific, technological and industrial breakthrough. Every dream is put into notion through imagination which final product depends on where that force is put into practice. Taking the three evolutionary components into consideration, we can clearly see that all are product of our imagination thus, imagination is not lost even long after the appearance of industry, science and technology .",There is a type of mutual relationship between these two opposites.,C2
120_FIJY1043.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"When people think about feminism, they usually consider it as an ideology based on the thought about the cause of women. But what exactly does the term cause of women mean? Is it the principle of ordinary women striving for the equality of the sexes or that of ardent feminists who would like to dominate the whole world and men? It is definitely not easy to answer this question, because there are various opinious about what the cause of women really is. It seems that also the word feminism has many meanings in our society. The original meaning probably is the one that defines feminism as an activity aiming at equal rights and chances for men and women. However, the complexity of those two concepts often leads to misunderstandings .
On second thoughts, it is true that when you hear or see the word feminism, you immediately know that it has something to do with the female sex. This is a simple fact known to everybody, but has anyone ever wondered why this movement striving for equality has a name that totally excludes the opposite sex? A man can't be a feminist. The movement is not called the equality movement but the feminist movement, for women only. Thus, the name divides people into male and female. That is why it is often thought that the whole ideology is against men, which means that it can't be for equality. Feminists are regarded as women having a dislike of men, which on no account is a good thing for their reputation .
It must be admitted that there is a natural division into men and women that we just have to accept. This physiological and, above all, psychological difference is purely positive - without it the relationships between men and women would be pretty boring... Our bodies are different, we think in slightly different ways, etc. Unfortunately, the fact that this difference exists has always made one of the sexes think that it is entitled to oppress and dominate the opposite one. In the history of the world men have usually been the dominators, for the simple reason that they are stronger. Though there are some primitive cultures led by women, they are only exceptions to the rule. Nowadays, the situation is changing. The change started in the 1960's and it has been a fast one. At that time, there was a sexual revolution going on in the western society. People no longer appreciated the old, conservative values that were full of references to religion. All that made it easier for the feminist movement to find support especially among young women. In a way, the emphasis was on sexuality, which affected the so-called feminist issues. Abortion became the hot issue. This changed the reputation of feminists. Earlier there had been demands for the right to vote, which had been attained. Women became militant and war broke out between the sexes. Feminists called each other sisters and some groups of women even lived together. Such intimacy made people consider them all as lesbians. Furthermore, those women started acting like men - burning their bras was a symbol of this change in their lifestyle. These were not the most brilliant feminist ideas, but they still influence the way people think. The characteristics of a feminist date back to 1960's: she is considered as an angry old maid who looks like a man .
Today, many women refuse to say they are feminists, because people have such negative attitudes towards them. Contrary to what might be thought, lots of women start to abandon this movement that should support women's rights. And yet they want equal pay, a right to education and work just like feminists. At the same time, the ""real"" feminists start to accuse those women of being stupid victims of men. There has to be something wrong with the whole movement. It has achieved lots of important goals that make women's situation better, but it also has had some harmful effects on the cause of women. The barrier between the sexes is still getting stronger even though people struggle for equality. Who is to blame? Men? Feminists? Non-feminists? Probably all of them. So why not try and solve our problems together without thinking so much about feminism, chauvinism or any other ideologies? It may be difficult, but it certainly is worth trying .","However, the complexity of those two concepts often leads to misunderstandings .",C2

108_FIHE1008.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"To dream is human, and imagination is the one thing that has got us where we are today. To say that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination in this brave modern world of ours is to say that we have reached the end of the line, that we have no place left to go. Human beings will always continue to momentarily gaze, eyes unfocused, into foggy nothingness or distant horizon, and dream. Actually, the advanced technology gives us a better change to this than anything ever before. TV, videos, computer games, to name just a few, are all tickets to imaginary worlds. Dreams for sale. And the book, the novel, is not dead either, quite the opposite in fact .
Dreaming and science are in symbiosis with each other. Without the former there could surely not be the latter. If the ancient Greeks had not dreamed about Icarus, would we have airplanes? If Columbus had not dreamed that there is land beyond the sunset, land to west of West, would anyone have found any reason to sail there? There will always be great soulful men with grand visions and dreams, and there will always be great men of science, who burn to prove that those visions and dreams are true or false. Men had visited the moon in their dreams thousands of times before it was actually done, and it has been dreamed thousands of times after that. Science fiction authors imagine unlikely futures, and to everybody's surprise the technology catches up, and afterwards those same writers, or the next generation, dream unlikely futures based upon the new discoveries. Of course, most of those dream futures stay just that, dreams, but few drive scientists into brilliant frenzies of creation, and the cycle goes on and on, to infinity. When William Gibson wrote his novel ""Neuromancer"" less than ten years ago, it was just another science fiction book. But today Virtual Reality, people being able to enter computer generated worlds via special helmets, is no longer just science fiction. Imagination is fuel to science, and vice versa .
Though times change people continue to dream. Even the basic subject of dreams stays almost the same. Granted, we no longer entertain ourselves with imaginary stories about quarrelsome gods of Olympus, but even though faces and settings change the essence of the tales does not. Not that all those old heroes and divine beings are gone. They might have been through more than a few changes during the years but Thor and Morpheus, to name just two, still go on in their continuous monthly adventures in comic books, if no where else. And are monsterous terminator cyborgs and godlike artificial intelligences of today's science fiction, or Batman and the other caped crusaders of comic books, or the Bold and the Beautiful really all that different from wrathful gods, devious dragons, knights of the round table, or the creatures of Fairyland? Heaven and Hell might have changed into virtual reality but in the Theatre of Dreams of this modern era the tales of love, hate, lust, war, sacrifice, revenge and redemption are still going strong. In a way we are fortunate that we have such a rich mythological base, accumulated through ages, to draw upon. Dreams shift and change, merge and split, turn into something new, but they never really die or disappear without leaving at least faint echoes rippling through the waves of time. Vampires and werewolves might have changed their capes and canes into boots and leather jackets, and their hoods and jewellery into sunglasses and computer wiring, but they still haunt our imagination .
Imagination is what makes us human. We have lived without technology but never without dreams. It might even be that in distant, or not so distant, future science and technology reach the point where they have been taken beyond the understanding of the common man. We dreamed when we still thought that fire was magic, and we will dream when we think so again. Come what may, people will continue to dream. Imagination has taken as this far, and it will take us to wherever it is that we are going. As for that, my imagination tells me that to say that the sky is the limit is to be too modest .","When William Gibson wrote his novel ""Neuromancer"" less than ten years ago, it was just another science fiction book.",C2
145_FRUL2001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"What strikes me about Marx's original sentence is its provocative aspect. To compare religion and its medium, the church, to a drug is a clear statement. Opium at that time was mainly used as a tranquillizer for sick people in hospitals and was still a legal drug. It is true that some people became opium addicted, in most cases as a consequence of the unknown effects that opium can have on a man's body, if the doses are not controlled by a specialized doctor. Marx saw that religion was used in the same way as the drug. It was meant to satisfy all the people's needs and as an answer to all questions. As a philosopher, Marx clearly recognized the manipulation done by the church, their priests and their interpretation of the Bible. Therefore he claimed the liberation and emancipation from religion .
But nowadays the situation has changed. Most churches, especially the traditional ones, share the same problem which is that of becoming more and more unpopular. Religion and faith do not have the same importance they had a century ago. Already the Roman [Illegible word/phrase] knew the basic needs of the masses: ""panem et circenses"". But the question of bread is not one of life or death nowadays, and most people only turn to religion on such occasions as a funeral or christmas Day, another institution became to play the centre part in every's life and that is television .
This phenomenon became clearly visible in the last two decades and has not reached its climax yet. The main reason for this is that TV satisfies the basic desire to be entertained. So it is not surprising to find at least one TV set in every household. It is the number one mass media. TV not only transmits news and information, game shows and the latest sport results, but also commercials, and this turns out to be its only purpose. The effects of television on our culture have already been described by such authors as Neil Postman, who shows the influence that commercials have. Since TV producers depend on the money paid by the advertisers not only the structure of the TV programme has changed but also our capability of telling reality from fiction. It is well known that films and even the news are splitted into fragments to allow the industries to praise their products, but rather unknown what effect this has on the quality of the programme. The lower its level of comprehension, the better, as if its aim was to be bad that the break for the commercials might function as the climax of the programme. It seems that even the seriousness of the news can not be rescued. We all have learned not to believe everything we read in a newspaper but on the other hand we trust everything that passes as news on TV; who would mistrust his own eyes? The average viewer does not ask himself, how the camera team always manages to be at the right place, at the right time. In our consumption-oriented society only one thing counts: how to realise an increase in sales and to get more consumers? Higher viewing figures guarantee more money. And we play the game and turn the TV on every day because we get what we want, and that is entertainment. We don't recognize that television does not satisfy our needs but only supplies superficialities and so we swallow it all .
What the drugs in our streets and the television have in common is their orientation towards consumption only. Marx would have been among the first to point this out, perhaps in a sentence similar to that in the title, but than he would have also replaced opium with crack .","The effects of television on our culture have already been described by such authors as Neil Postman, who shows the influence that commercials have.",C2
107_FIHE1001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Karl Marx has said that religion was the opium of the masses. I assume that he meant the enormous effect religion has on people; they think that the one they believe in is the only right and are deaf to all other ones. For some people religion is the only thing that matters in this life and nothing else is worth thinking of. Through the ages people have fought and killed for their religion, a fact that again shows how mad and insensitive religion can make us. Not so long ago, I heard a suggestion that if Marx was alive today he would replace religion with television. In some respects this claim seems to be reasonable, but I do have to think twice before maintaining that television has replaced religion in the real life like in this sentence of Marx .
It is true that television has a great role in the life of an average human being; hurrying home after a workday to see The Bold And The Beautiful resembles quite shockingly the necessity of attending a church service regularly. And similarly to the way religion gives people hope of a better life television provides us with the means to escape from this sometimes too depressing world for a while. Formerly families used to read the Bible together, today it might be a wildlife TV-serial that gathers the family up. The Bible tells us what is right or wrong and television advertisements tell us what is the best detergent and how our hair becomes smooth and silky. Both religion and television dull and confuse our mind. Each religion explains things in a one and only possible way, there is no room for any own or other kind of thinking. Television, too, gives us very simple and one-sided views and ready and easy answers and doesn't encourage us to think independently. One more thing that is common to religion and television is the way they both twist our sense of reality. Some sects are appalling examples how religion can lead people to even such an extreme decision as a mass suicide, and I am sure that many youngsters don't realise that a kick in the head can be lethal although the heroes of TV-series never die of one or even get hurt .
Indeed, there seems to be a lot in common between religion and television, and a phrase ""television is the opium of the masses"" sounds, at least to me, pretty accurate. And as it is a fact that nowadays religion is much less important than it used to be, could it, then, be that television has replaced it in the real life, too? No, I do not think so. Although both television and religion offer people a way to escape from the ""worldly"" pressures, resorting to religion is a much more conscious and acceptable choice than getting addicted to some stupid TV-series or drugs. I cannot think of anyone being proud of his/her devotion to the telly, but, as we all know, some religious fanatics are ready to kill or get killed for their faith. This is probably because of the notion most of us fortunately still have that there is always other human beings behind every television program, not some supernatural forces that could be compared to any religious, or ideological, power .","Not so long ago, I heard a suggestion that if Marx was alive today he would replace religion with television.",C2
318_MDCM3039.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Every man is constantly shaped and influenced by his experiences. I find money the root of all evil for the following reasons: it makes people greedy, creates faulty values, and divides people according to social status.
	First of all, love of money is a recognized evil, that is born out of an excessive desire for it. There is a famous proverb that says ""Greed begets sin, sin begets death."" Furthermore, people in developed societies are in a vicious circle. They work hard so that they can earn more money. When they have more money, they spend more. The greed for money increases and they are never satisfied. And then, because they spend more, they have to work even harder. The circle goes round and round.
	Secondly, money caused a twisted turn in the real values of life since the times people started using gold and silver for trades. Health, family, friends and moral values were once a priority and not a concept. Marketing and advertising is overwhelming the population presenting idealistic images of high life styles and stressing the materialistic, hindering the spiritual. Therefore, people are subconsciously guided to worry more about the physical appearance of things. For example, with help of money, people undergo thousands of surgeries to gain a look appealing to the advertised standards of beauty. People find enjoyment in expensive comforts and have forgotten about feeding the spiritual, appreciating moments and people. The paradox is that they are losing their health, to pay for things and later on will be losing their money to pay for their health.
	Last but not least, there is the problem of dividing people according to social statuses. Society often judges people according to how much money they have, therefore money equals status. Rich and famous people receive better treatment in some institutions than poor. Usually, people of higher social status do not mingle with people of lower social status. People tend to look down on other who have less money than them. An example of this, could be the fact that in the past, marriages between two people of different social status were disapproved. Today, these marriages are always under the question of being out of interest. Moreover, money equals power. Many leaders of nations are completely disregarding the needs of the common people who support them. They manipulate and strive only towards accumulating their wealth.
	However, many may argue that money isn't the root of all evil. That excess of money could also be used for noble causes. Thus, Bill Gates donates millions of dollars through his foundation to help children in developing countries. These kind of people are guided by noble thoughts. People can argue that even without money, greed still exists and that crime is not triggered only by the possession or lack of money. For example, rape could be a result of lust, and murder a result of a quarrel. Moreover, some people think that money isn't the root of all evil, but rather the lack of money. Money is the result of hard-working process. Also, money motivates people to work smarter and harder. But then again, on the other hand, if there was no money, the lack of it, wouldn't adversely affect anyone. In my opinion, all the fears mentioned only exist because we need ' money ' to buy stuff. And if resources were distributed freely and equally, there would be no need for them.
	In conclusion, the question of money being a good or a bad thing, is debatable, but the fact stands that our world has become a dangerous place to live in, where decency, moral and freedom are just fading concepts that very few of us still remember. On a personal level, we ought to worry less about our image and bear in mind that too much power and wealth steals away piece of mind . ""Being"" and ""doing"" are much more important than ""having"". And ultimately, some evil may not have a lot to do with money, but most money have a lot to do with evil.","Marketing and advertising is overwhelming the population presenting idealistic images of high life styles and stressing the materialistic, hindering the spiritual.",C2

It is true that naïvety, dreaming and imagination are irremediably losing ground in our modern and highly civilized societies .
To begin with, all kinds of ""irrational religions"" which include more than one god or worship non-human divinities have been abolished. The civilizations which went on following their traditions were called ""primitives"", and there was a strong urge on the part of the western missionaries to teach them our modern principles and exploit them. So a mercantile interest overshadowed genuine and peaceful communities .
But now, it is religion itself which is somewhat losing importance in the life of the modern man. Some basic values and religious virtues are outdated, and finally no more reguarded as crucial. The modern man can peacefully enjoy life with the new prospects now offered to him by science, high technology and industry. He has got his personal comfort, his hous, his car, his television, his work, his funny gadgets, and he can have fun with the next-door girl. Why should he refuse?
Through history, religion was basically felt as a need, a help for the poor hungry masses that were busy trying to survive .
They could only appease their fears and misfortunes; find their hopes in religion. Religion was useful to keep them living and working .
Just as religion is more or less losing this ""utility"" in our modern world, dreaming and imagination are following the same way .
If you want to succeed in this society you only have to study, work hard, be intelligent, be beautiful, have money, and forget about the rest. No matter if people are unhappy around you! Instead of taking their human feelings into account, what you have to do in business is to try to solve a problem by means of figures, dollars, subsidies, profits... by counting, calculating and making abstraction of data of any other kind .
The most promising jobs in the future are those that involve finance, trade, business, diplomacy thus excluding dreaming and imagination we would find in the arts, for instance .
As a concrete example, I can mention what a young american student in economics told me during my holidays Singapore .
He is only twenty, comes from a rich family, he is beautiful, he has travelled a lot all over the world, he goes to one of the best universities in the States - I mean Yale - he has everything we could dream of. We had a talk about studies, and when I told him I was about to begin my last year in germanic philology, he replied that it must be all very well and funny to listen to some literature, history and philosophy, but that all this was really useless and that it wouldn't lead me very far if I wanted to have some kind of career worthy of this name .
Anyway, how sad would the world be if everybody was busy with economics!
We had some kind of ""privilege relationship"", and I was interested in the guy. But as I was not staying for a long time - I had to take the plane two weeks after - he tried to make me understand that it was impossible, that he was sad too but that I was really too irrational, that I was an idealist .
He, on the other hand, thought he had a good point at being an extremely realistic, materialistic man. He carefully warned me: Pay attention and take care of yourself. If you are too idealistic, you are going to fall back on the ground one day and suffer a great deal .
This is the kind of world we are living in right now. But without any dream we are just machines; perhaps we suffer but we do not feel any true joy either. And maybe in this world of machinery, pollution and high technology, the man will again feel the need to go back to his roots, live more simply and give some more place to sincere relationships and dreams .","The civilizations which went on following their traditions were called ""primitives"", and there was a strong urge on the part of the western missionaries to teach them our modern principles and exploit them.",C2
088_DBAN2033.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"How sad but true this is! Money and power, science technology and economy, industrialisation and education are the things that really matter in our society. Nowadays dreaming and imagination are becoming more and more second-rate. Our priorities seem to have gone through some changes .
Power, money, technology... are the criteria for 'success' in life and for just being heard and respected. Without success you are nothing in this society. what is striking is, that we seem to have forgotten what it means to be truly happy. We confuse success with happiness. No doubt happiness cannot possibly be obtained without dreams and imagination, without feelings and emotions. Nowadays everything is insensitive, cold, unfeeling..., which is a big problem in our society. There is this fight for survival, everybody on its own in the big bad world. Feelings are inconvenient, superfluous in all aspects of life. They are considered to be the ' things' that hold you back. This is especially the case in business, which is no doubt a dominant factor in our society . ' Business is business' has become a common notion. There is no place for compation, charity, the same way that there is no place for dreaming and imagination. It all boils down to making a profit, productivity, accomplishment .
There is also a lack of time for dreaming, imagination and plain creativity. Our days are carefully planned and more than filled (the rush of daily life). Sure, we still dream but almost only at night, unconscious of it. by the time we have woken up we have forgotten all about it. It does not interest us anymore, we have other things on our minds like work, school, appointments...money, money, money. People get caught in this mill of things and do not see any way out .
Imagination and dreaming are a form of freedom where natural boundaries are exceeded. In our imagination we bare our souls, either conscious or not, with its desires, fears and creative possibilities. Imaginaiton is an introspective tool. We are in a world then where our minds take a broad sweep, where it is not relevant whether or not something is realised, or if problems are solved or created. Imagination is also not something we can force upon ourselves. But it is a necessity for humans to be whole. It is one of the things that distinguishes us from other living creatures .
The negligence of the importance of dreaming and imagination is prevalent at all ages. Even toys nowadays do not leave much to imagination. The more complicated, artificial (supplied with technical devices) the better. Children do not really play anymore. They are no longer creative. They are handed these ' revolutionary ' toys or just put in front of the television in order to keep them busy. This is very passive without the development of the personality or the mind .
People in general spend a considerable amount of time watching TV, which is at the expense of other leisure activities. It has also been proven that TV steals time which would otherwise have been spend on imagination. TV is an ' easy ' medium which requires little mental effort. This leads to a passive ' let you entertain me'-attitude which undermines the willingness to think something up ourselves. TV also undermines the ability to focus your attention on something for quite a long time, which is needed for imagination. TV leads to over-excitement, impulsive thinking, a reduction of attention and restless behaviour. This is also determined by the kind of programmes we watch . ' Kind ' programmes leave our imagination undisturbed. Programmes with much violence and action, however, are adverse on our imagination .
It is really a shame, that we seem to choose for a life without imagination or dreaming. Is happiness not to be found in our minds and hearts rather than in material things, our bank account...? Chateaubriand once said that true happiness is to be found in little things, that if it costs much it is not of the right kind. Our priorities and values in life have changed. We need scientific arguments, proof before we believe in something. We are all very much involved in trying to make something of our lives without really living, experiencing it. We do not seem to care about dreaming and imagination because we believe that it does not provide us with something. Or is this my ' imagination'?","Programmes with much violence and action, however, are adverse on our imagination .",C2
311_MDCM2032.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Education is one of the main sources in every person's intellectual development, affecting our lives in one way or another. Moreover, it still remains as a silent issue of discussion with less or no effort done to understand our educational system and the presenting of knowledge to young and imaginative human minds. In comparison to the past, more and more of the young people decide to dedicate themselves to their studies and intellectual improvement, believing that the money and the effort put in it will be of great importance in their future life as young educated individuals. The main issue which is going to be discussed further on is whether the university degrees are of real value, and whether they prepare people for the real world.
	To begin with, all of us are aware of the purpose of the university studies. What the real question is, whether the studies succeed in realizing the purpose. The university students are forced to memorize information, but what they really need in order to be prepared for the real world is personal growth training, financial management training, communication training, emotional intelligence training, and healthy living training. Some people believe that the university is not place where life skills should be learned, but rather an educational institution which prepares students for job-careers. The problem is that statistics show that 53.6% of college graduates, under the age of 25, are out of work or underemployed, which is yet another thing to bear in mind when thinking of the real value of the university degree.
	David Ellis in his article for ""The Telegraph"" discusses the way universities teach students to fail in ""real life"". [Quotation] [Reference] He says that a degree is nothing more but a proof that you wanted to learn, can learn and will keep learning. It shows your mind has been [Quotation] [Reference] . What he tries to say is that the university degree is simply not enough. People make mistakes by encouraging too many students into university, and at the same time forcing them to believe that the purpose of the university is entirely professionally oriented.
	The previous article goes hand in hand with Aliezah Hulett TED-Ed Club talk on the topic ""Preparing Students for the Real World"". She raises questions as: ""Are teenagers today prepared for life after school?"" The school system and parents should be working together to raise educated students. Schools should be accountable for instructing students to be knowledgeable about the world around them. It should be a joint effort between parent and educator to train the next generation of children to be independent and prepared for the real life. One of the topics discussed is whether university student would be able to handle the sense of responsibility and maturity that comes from having a job. When someone puts their head down to achieve their goals by themselves, as an independent adult, their outcome will reflect what they learned in both college and ""real life school"". Similarly the Northeastern University economists Paul E. Harrington and Andrew M. Sum argue the most pressing problem facing the university graduates today: overeducation on one hand and malemployment on the other. The reality is that more and more college graduates are stuck in low wage and low skilled jobs . [Quotation] [Reference] Also, this article contains an example of a certain graduate student S.F. who got a degree in Network and information-technology administration, and after he couldn't find a job, the Eastern Michigan University gave him a job as a custodian in the student center. This very example makes us consider the value of the university degree and ask ourselves whether the degree is really needed in order to become successful and financially stable in the future or it is just a way to manipulate the hard working students and make business based on their effort and hard work.
	All in all, the university degree is not an infallible way for safe and great career as many people consider. When students enter the real world, besides the knowledge gained from education, they need wisdom and specific skills that are not offered in our educational system. Therefore the universities do not produce real-life prepared students and the university degree is not valuable in a way of guaranteed job or career opportunity. The world demands people who can think creatively and differently, take opportunities to compromise their true dreams and hopes, and grow a personality by breaking the boundaries of the everyday teaching.",Schools should be accountable for instructing students to be knowledgeable about the world around them.,C2
107_FIHE1001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Karl Marx has said that religion was the opium of the masses. I assume that he meant the enormous effect religion has on people; they think that the one they believe in is the only right and are deaf to all other ones. For some people religion is the only thing that matters in this life and nothing else is worth thinking of. Through the ages people have fought and killed for their religion, a fact that again shows how mad and insensitive religion can make us. Not so long ago, I heard a suggestion that if Marx was alive today he would replace religion with television. In some respects this claim seems to be reasonable, but I do have to think twice before maintaining that television has replaced religion in the real life like in this sentence of Marx .
It is true that television has a great role in the life of an average human being; hurrying home after a workday to see The Bold And The Beautiful resembles quite shockingly the necessity of attending a church service regularly. And similarly to the way religion gives people hope of a better life television provides us with the means to escape from this sometimes too depressing world for a while. Formerly families used to read the Bible together, today it might be a wildlife TV-serial that gathers the family up. The Bible tells us what is right or wrong and television advertisements tell us what is the best detergent and how our hair becomes smooth and silky. Both religion and television dull and confuse our mind. Each religion explains things in a one and only possible way, there is no room for any own or other kind of thinking. Television, too, gives us very simple and one-sided views and ready and easy answers and doesn't encourage us to think independently. One more thing that is common to religion and television is the way they both twist our sense of reality. Some sects are appalling examples how religion can lead people to even such an extreme decision as a mass suicide, and I am sure that many youngsters don't realise that a kick in the head can be lethal although the heroes of TV-series never die of one or even get hurt .
Indeed, there seems to be a lot in common between religion and television, and a phrase ""television is the opium of the masses"" sounds, at least to me, pretty accurate. And as it is a fact that nowadays religion is much less important than it used to be, could it, then, be that television has replaced it in the real life, too? No, I do not think so. Although both television and religion offer people a way to escape from the ""worldly"" pressures, resorting to religion is a much more conscious and acceptable choice than getting addicted to some stupid TV-series or drugs. I cannot think of anyone being proud of his/her devotion to the telly, but, as we all know, some religious fanatics are ready to kill or get killed for their faith. This is probably because of the notion most of us fortunately still have that there is always other human beings behind every television program, not some supernatural forces that could be compared to any religious, or ideological, power .","Television, too, gives us very simple and one-sided views and ready and easy answers and doesn't encourage us to think independently.",C2

Still all throughout the history of his species man have fought for equality. It has turned out that indeed some men are more equal than others. at least socially. And that is quite naturally .
All men cannot be equal. Each one of us is born with different capacity of mind and heart, at different places, under different conditions. Some have more wits or are more open-hearted than others, some have loving parents and a happy childhood, others do not. Some were born with a certain position in society which have secured them better opportunities for education, professional realization, personal or social success, for achieving their goals. Some were handicapped by the conditions of life under which they were born from their first breath of air to the last beat of their heart, entangled in a cruel reality, fighting for every piece of bread in order to keep living just to be able to go on fighting .
Some like their inherited position of life, others do not. Some conform it, others rebel. Some fight for equality, others for a higher status to be more equal than the others .
All men cannot be equal. Not each of us want to have the same conditions of life, opportunities or privileges as the others, some want better ones. Some want to be rich. The some money from the rich, give it to the poor and then we all shall be equal and happy. But there will always be someone who will wish to have more money, to be more equal .
Some want to have social power. Give more civil rights to the oppressed, restrict the influence of the powerful and we again shall be equal. But shall we be powerful? Over what and, most of all, over whom shall we exert our power? Here comes the need of unequality. There have to be oppressed to make the others feel powerful. Moreover, being influential and having power is not easy as it seems .
All men cannot be equal. That is just an utopia. A beautiful dream cherished in the hearts of generations of men throughout the centuries. Our life is based on inequality. Society, even nature is based on inequality. Some say that life is a jungle. In the jungle one cannot afford themselves to be weak and unfit. If one is not strong enough, they simply perish. The stronger need the weaker to live on them. It is the best that survive. The most equal one. There should be death to secure life. There is life owing to inequality. Inequality produces the fittest, the ones who survive .

Inequality is recognized and accepted by men. What else is the evolutionary theory about the survival of the fittest than a rejection of equality. If all were equal who would have survived.? All of us?

333_NOHO1026.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"My father in law loves to discuss with me. And because I am a rather quiet and peace loving person he is the one who has to take the initiative - which he does as provocative as possible. It was about this time of the year (the end f February) that he once asked me: ""My dear daughter in law, in what way will you contribute the eighth of March?""
He was probably looking forward to a juicy discussion, but I guess he asked the wrong person or maybe I could say he asked the wrong generation. The International Women's Day has occurred 32 times in my life but the thought of contributing in one way or another has never crossed my mind and I believe a lot of women in my age would say the same. Feminism is a non-existent topic but in the back of our minds we despise the feminists and call them names: Man-looking man-haters who threw their bras and forced abortion upon every woman .
On the other hand we take it for granted that our husbands cook, do the dishes and change diapers as much as we do. Are we ungrateful heiresses to what is gained throughout a century of ""war""? Or have feminists done more harm than good to the cause of women? My answers will not be based upon research but simply upon my own observations and thoughts being a mother and wife - and obviously a woman .
Please your husband, take care of your children, and accept whatever comes; these were your only instructions and rights a hundred years ago. I think most Norwegian women are happy that they live today. Some of my girl friends are film directors, shop owners, designers, dancers, newspaper reporters, top athletes, musicians and doctors. Some are single mothers and own their own apartment. We have conquered every stage of society; the world is at our feet .
But the discontent always speaks out loud. Enough is never enough and it might seem pathetic that some feminists still are so extremely angry - because women aren't represented 50% in the best paid jobs, quota above qualification. I am sure I could point at several bad things that took place in the name of feminism. But this is where I think the feminist warriors have lost their way: in their eagerness to achieve equality they ignored to define what feminism truly is as a starting point .
We cannot deny the fact that we are women; nothing can change that (except an operation of course). Have we lost our feminine character? Oh, we are so fit and good looking and anorectic and dress like hookers but in an expensive way so as not to be mistaken for one, but do we feel female? Are we too hooked up in the money race that we don't recognise our own gender? We give birth to kids that we put in kindergarten, have full time jobs (or even more because carrier demands it) and someone (a woman?) to wash our big houses .
What are the female characteristics - things that men don't have? We do not dare to ask our men. That would be very degrading to admit our lack of knowledge and a huge step backwards. Why do ""they"" find the South European women so attractive? The modern super model carrier woman doesn't need a man except as a sex partner. She wants children but success is more important. She sees her children 30 tired hours a week while more than 40 hours a week she gives all her energy to the job. Making other priorities is a total failure .
We've become like our men, but as a result of this our men have become like us. Why do ""we"" find South European men so attractive? While we eagerly have struggled for our quotas, the enemy has become wife-ridden and henpecked. What a misunderstanding of female integrity!
However, a glimpse of a burka-wearing person in Yemen is enough to conclude that we are quite lucky to live in this ""androgyny"" society. Feminism has certainly contributed in making our world cynical and selfish, but in order to create change and revolution things needed to be stirred up, provoked and brought to the extreme edges .

In fact, the 19th century was the century of industrialization and was marked by the pursuit of maximal profit. In this pursuit man and nature had no place at all. Probably Victor Hugo clearly perceived this situation .
What Victor Hugo said in the 19th century is still true for the 20th century and even more so. Yet if we had to paraphrase his sentence, we would probably say that [Quotation] . The awareness that man is part of nature goes back to the 1960's, at the time of man's first journeys in space. At that moment astronauts from different missions clearly perceived the earth as being a closed system, like a deserted island lost in the middle of an ocean, and therefore they saw it as a fragile system that needs a strict managment in order to avoid an ecological desaster, in order to save it .
Bit by bit this idea has gained ground. Thus in the 1970's we see the birth of many ecological movements. Little by little the ""calling out of nature"" has reached some ears and man is trying to find an appropriate solution. The more man interferes with nature in a careless way, the more he seeks assurance that somewhere it is beyond his responsibility. Now man's longing expresses itself in catalogues full of ""back-to-nature"" remarks and in the popularity of films like ""Dances with the Wolves"" or ""Le Grand Bleu"". There is a longing to return to a healthier life. Now people dream of what life was like before industrialization .
But now we may wonder whether it is not already too late: the oceans die, rivers and sees are polluted by runoff from industrial plans and by spills from tankers and ships, the atmosphere is getting warmer with the greenhouse effect, certain species of animals are endangered, non-recyclable material waste increase every day and our forests are attacked by acid rain. In short, nature is in danger, we are in danger and the situation requires a quick reaction. Our leaders should come to an agreement in order to set up a special program that would be really efficient. But unfortunatly economical interests come first, they come before mankind's general interest .
It is possible that it is already too late, even if nature absorbs many of our attacks. It is probable that we have gone too far. Except for the ecologists, none of the decision-making people (politicians, industrialists, ...) seem to be willing to do something that goes against this auto-destructive tendenc .

343_NOUO2003.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The claim that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination because our modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is, in my opinion, downright stupid. I also think that such a claim reveals a sense of nostalgia I think has little or no relevance to the genres, or professions if you like, which best express contemporary thought and ideas, namely literature, music and arts. In this essay I will try to elaborate on a few point in order to explain my view .
Frankly, I find the claim hard to grasp. Do humans dream less because of the invention of the microchip? Has our imagination diminished because we can now read books on the Internet? I think the claim could be narrowed down to ""evolution kills imagination"". Considering that humans still possess imagination, I feel tempted to point out the obvious: Human culture has evolved since the beginning. When did science and technology stop us from dreaming? Was it the invention of the lightbulb that killed our imagination? Rhetorical questions aside, here is my point: When one speaks of dreaming and imagination, then this nostalgia, this longing for the past, should be seen as much more dangerous than science and imagination. These are all traits that go hand in hand, and they are distinctly human. In fact, a modern world dominated by science and machines gives way to new dreams and new ways of thinking. Science fiction can be seen as an example of this, and so can electronic music. I have the feeling that someone capable of declaring that science and technology leaves no space for imagination, might not be the biggest Sci-fi nut .
Modern techniques such as photo rendering and computer graphics are new tools available to the modern artist. Sampling and the use of computers have become essentials in creating various forms of modern music, and writers of all kinds now use word processing. Modern technology can not only be a tool easing the creative prosess, it can also make new forms of creativity possible. Some critics argue that the use of modern tools such as computers often results in inferior quality. To that I can only say that the artist has the sole responsibility. It should be fairly obvious that the choice of tools directly influences the creative process. Some even argue that musicians should not need to go to school to develop a high level of proficiency on their instruments. They fear that schooling takes away the individual character of an up-and-coming musician. In response to such fears I quote the renowned guitarist Bill Frisell: ""It's only the players' fault if they let themselves be programmed by the routines that these places establish."" He continues: ""For example, in the harmony classes at Berklee, they'd have ' avoid notes', notes you weren't supposed to use over a particular chord. Naturally, those were the first ones I'd check out."" (Guitar Player, July 1992) I think the combined output of all contemporary artistic activity is a clear indicator of the state of mankind. Many argue that this is precisely the job of an artist; to mirror contemporary ideas and thoughts in all its shapes .
Industrialisation and new technology inevitably shapes our daily life and the world around us, hence it also influences the way we think and the way we dream. Invention and progress should be seen as assets, not burdens, of living in modern times. I think a key point in this discussion is whether the comforts of modern life, with all its impressive gadgets and its focus on effectiveness, leaves us with more spare time to dream or not. I believe that is often the case, and if not, one should reconsider the ways in which the fruits of modern times are employed. The responsibility of an action is that of the performer, not the tool. Thanks to word processing, I have been able to spend more time elaborating on this essay than actually writing it .","The responsibility of an action is that of the performer, not the tool.",C2
105_FIAB1054.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"If Karl Marx were alive today, he probably would call television the opium of the masses. There are very good reasons for this, reasons that the average ' tube consumer ' would perhaps not think about. And the reason for not thinking lies in the medium: the television .
There is perhaps no other ethermedium today that is so effective a tool for manipulation of the human mind than is television. At least this is true in the Western world, where watching television is, most likely, the most popular form of leisure activity. The reasons for the popularity of television can in my opinion be sought in the simple fact that man is lazy above all other things. Man does not want to trouble his brain more than necessary. The television also satifies one of man's basic needs: his curiosity. Television is an excellent way of taking a peek at what other people are doing, and how. In the programmes that run on from night to night, the viewer can identify with the people and the lifestyles that he is offered, or, he can look down on what he sees and gain certain pleasure also from his negative feelings. It is no wonder that the tube is interesting. Because of this interest, somebody who wants to use television for propaganda purposes can be sure that he always has an audience, willing to take in whatever is on the menu .
Marx would probably see the TV as the ultimate capitalist monster, at least when looking at the United States, where more money is spent on the medium than anywhere else. He would be very right, in the way that the capital really controls the medium and the messages that it relays to the masses. Air time costs a great deal of money, so it does not take much to come to the conclusion that the upper layers of society can control the airways. Television is also the tool of the market. An audiovisual advertisement is very effective, and the people working for the media industry know how to make one. It is of course true of all types of programmes that they have to be well made in order to get through with the desired impact, so certain demands are put on the machinery producing the programmes. If there is no extensive private media market, the broadcasting is usually a state enterprise. This is of course a danger in the way that it is very easy for the government to exercise censure .
There are also numerous positive aspects of television. It is a good medium of education, and a great carrier of important world events. The satellite era has brought almost unlimited possibilities with it. Unfortunately, it again a question of money. The television is an expensive medium, compared with for example the radio. The equipment that is needed is very costly for the broadcaster, not least because a huge transmitter network has to be built in order to reach out to the audience. The reason for this is the characteristics of the frequencies that are used. A TV receiver is also expensive compared with a radio, and because of this it is not suited for education projects et.c. in developing countries, where it really would fill an important function. On the other hand, it is quite evident that all the negative features of television would follow the positive .
If Marx would hold television as the opium of the 20th century, I would agree with him. The tube makes passive people who become more and more easy to manipulate as they carry on watching. But although I personally see television as something mainly negative, I would like to get the chance to remind mr. Marx that opium is used as a tranquilizer against pain. Maybe TV has a calming effect on its audience in these rough (?) times. At least we might be able to forget what kind of damage watching television does to us .","The equipment that is needed is very costly for the broadcaster, not least because a huge transmitter network has to be built in order to reach out to the audience.",C2

When it got dark, everyone (or almost everyone) went to sleep to get a good night's rest before starting another day's work early in the morning. In the winter people didn't go out very much; they spent the evenings close to the fireside, the women knitting and sewing, the men smoking their pipes or carving a toy out of wood .
When electric light was invented, people tended to stay at home more often and to stay up later. They took advantage of the fact that they could enjoy the light as long as they wanted. They still spent the evenings in family, but started doing other things: playing cards or other party games, reading a book or the paper if they could read, listening to the radio when that was invented, etc... People in the villages tended to spend less and less time in each other's company, and in the cities this situation was even worse (because cities are more often than not, less social than cosy little villages).

The remarkable thing is that most people don't seem to get sick and tired of seeing the same things happening over and over again. But then again, most people love to stick their nose in other people's affairs, and that is exactly what they can do in those series .

325_MDCM3065.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"If one characterizes this century as relying only on reason it is easy to extract imagination and the dreams from the centre and instead leave room for a different era that is the era of science, technology and industrialization which many people believe has deprived young people of any imagination and dreams. One is to believe that success is achieved through measuring the achievement in all the above spheres. However, it does not have to be so if one takes into consideration how these three spheres are interpersonally connected to imagination and dreams. This essay will further scrutinize how each three: science, technology and industrialization, are somewhere connected with imagination and dreams .
	If we take Imagination and science one can clearly see that they are seemingly unrelated. Imagination is taken as being the mere expression of a free thought whilst science is unyielding and rigorous. Science is bounded to fall within the understandable and reachable, in contrary imagination is without any boundaries. Both may seem completely different but what most people cannot see is that they are somewhat connected. One similarity that comes to mind is the balance between the two forces that are struggling tenaciously to achieve something of thought. There is a type of mutual relationship between these two opposites. Namely, science needs imagination to thrive, whilst imagination needs some sort of scientific support to function. If one takes scientists as being people strictly following rules and laws we must also engage with the thought that they also need imagination in the creative process. Also, imagists need to rely on science, if not they will fall in utter chaos. Consequently, imagination seems to be present even with parallel existence of science .
	The question we should be asking here is ""what is technology without the imagination part?"" What I am trying to imply here is that, technology is not just the invention of GPS, gadgets and telephones; it is the process that allows our imagination to transpire into the real world. An author enthusiastic about this theme holds that [Quotation] . To prove that, let me take you to Dick Tracy's cartoons where the wrist watch was also a walkie-talkie which has now become reality incorporated in our smart phones. It is a perfect example of imagination brought to the fore and creating something that we nowadays call a technology process. Take this citation for example [Quotation] . So to conclude, imagination is not lost here either, it is just how we perceive things .
	Industrialization can also be seen as interchangeable with imagination. If we take Slater's spinning machine which he produced from memory, the evidence is clear how imagination played a big role in this industrialization part. Another example are the railroads thanks to which transport of goods and people went swiftly and quickly. Let us take into consideration the imagination of an author such as Charles Dickens and his novel Hard Times. He put the question of industrial society as a subject to what might be entitled as the mobilization of imagination. Thus, proving once again how imagination can be put into practice to elaborate on the theme of industrialization .
	To conclude, science, technology and industrialization have all something in common. Namely, they all emerge from one single force that is our imagination. Maria Montessori stated that [Quotation] . In other words, imagination is the starting point which leads to scientific, technological and industrial breakthrough. Every dream is put into notion through imagination which final product depends on where that force is put into practice. Taking the three evolutionary components into consideration, we can clearly see that all are product of our imagination thus, imagination is not lost even long after the appearance of industry, science and technology .",An author enthusiastic about this theme holds that [Quotation] .,C2

224_IRMA12008.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Since the advent of neural synapse in human brain people were concerned how to turn ideas into action. You should keep in mind that the question provided can be subjectively addressed by anyone who comes across with it. Here I'll briefly mention two thick walls that separate us from the spectrum of knowledge and practice. To begin with, the lack of the right method of learning within universities. Secondly, the absence of sheer will force in each and every individual within the period of education. With these contextual and intrapersonal factors, the graduates can rarely relate university learning to real life problems therefore I think the university degrees are becoming more theoretical nationally . 

	Throughout the world or at least in the developed countries the current established method of learning is PBL(Problem Based Learning), unfortunately we are still living in the stone era of implementing the modern approaches and methods of education in the curriculum design. The method Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject just like real life through the experience of problem solving. Students learn both thinking strategies and domain knowledge. The goals of PBL are to help the students develop flexible knowledge, effective problem solving skills, self-directed learning, effective collaboration skills and intrinsic motivation that are critically important in encountering real life situations. The tutor builds students' confidence to take on the problem, and encourages the students, while also stretching their understanding. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy, which is more often lecture-based, theoretically passed, contains way more theoretical units than practical ones and it is used in the whole nation as the primary method of teaching. PBL educates students in a way that they would behave efficiently not only in a domain specific task but also in real life problem solving ones. Our system of education lacks such a perfectly designed method of teaching and learning. So the students cannot benefit from real life stimulations and as a result the problem of relating university learning to real life situations arises.


	Preparation for real life starts since birth. From childhood the humans interacts with the real world through trial and error, reasoning and prior experience of others. Consequently each human being perceives the surrounding world differently from one another; some choose to gain experience from a mistake and look at it positively, meanwhile others try to ignore the whole happening and bury it deep down among other unpleasant errors of human kind. Like all the changes in human condition success comes from will; with the brute force of perseverance the individual can outwit the real life challenge eventually. Since this four legged creature is capable of thinking and making decisions from childhood, in the end the choice is up to the person whether to develop a will toward succession or to be doomed to failure. Observational studies have shown that people think life is becoming harder to get by each year. The reasons and motives for such negative attitude could be economical, regional, psychological, physiological, political, cultural and personal. Thus not having the required volition causes increased rates of difficulty in encountering real life situations . 


The failure in preparation of students for real life can be caused by two reasons. First, problem of do not having the right implemented approach to learning, teaching and assessment that could best serve the growing number of applicants in different fields of study in order to relate theory to practice in real life. Second, we have the power of will; you and I know that it would have the strength to melt mountains to the surface if it is used in a way to see problems solvable and goals reachable. Accordingly the reasons for such depravation may arise from the surrounding of a person or from within him/herself.","Since this four legged creature is capable of thinking and making decisions from childhood, in the end the choice is up to the person whether to develop a will toward succession or to be doomed to failure.",C2

It is definitely not easy to answer this question, because there are various opinious about what the cause of women really is. It seems that also the word feminism has many meanings in our society. The original meaning probably is the one that defines feminism as an activity aiming at equal rights and chances for men and women. However, the complexity of those two concepts often leads to misunderstandings .

The movement is not called the equality movement but the feminist movement, for women only. Thus, the name divides people into male and female. That is why it is often thought that the whole ideology is against men, which means that it can't be for equality.

Though there are some primitive cultures led by women, they are only exceptions to the rule. Nowadays, the situation is changing. The change started in the 1960's and it has been a fast one. At that time, there was a sexual revolution going on in the western society. People no longer appreciated the old, conservative values that were full of references to religion. All that made it easier for the feminist movement to find support especially among young women. In a way, the emphasis was on sexuality, which affected the so-called feminist issues. Abortion became the hot issue. This changed the reputation of feminists. Earlier there had been demands for the right to vote, which had been attained.

131_FRUB1022.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. This claim witnesses not only a certain uneasiness on the part of the students but also a more general feeling of emptiness. Oddly enough, it is simultaneously a rather contemporary idea and a universal doubt. I have chosen to regard this reality from the student's point of view, for he is the most concerned .
In the first instance, it is of importance to analyse properly the signification of ""real world"". Does it refer to the working life, or to the practical knowledge of one's activity in life? Should we read in this assertion an implied contrast between two successive stages in one's life: the first, theoretical knowledge found in books, preparing the following step, the actual use of this cognizance? Clearly it states that academic knowledge has divorced from real world, that university is no school of life .
How could one agree with such a biased view. I propose in this essay to enlight the subject from a more nuanced angle. Before I set up my arguments, I would like to underline the fact that one has to distinguish between different sorts of intelligences, which should ideally complement each other. This consideration brings me to the core of the problem, the central flaw of the education system .
Admittely, one fails to bridge the gap between formal learning, that has been piled up since early times, the synthesis of which you get acquainted with at university; and the accurate understanding of it followed by an adequate actualisation .
At this point we may wonder if the task of professors goes as far as to lead us step by step, prudently spoonfeeding us; in order to help us pass successfully from the stage of understanding, integrating knowledge to the judicious release of it with regard to the existential situation. Opinions are divided on this question, but as far as I am concerned, I truly believe that this task can only be performed by each student individually. However, one is bound to take into account the fact that obviously students are still expecting an external guide to conduct them on the road of life .
Looking at the problem from a positive point of view, there is nevertheless no denying that university opens our intellectual horizons. But it does not account for an inward maturing process, built on discursive emotions, experiences pleasant, impressive, instructive, as well as disruptive, shocking or sterile; recondite sensations, feelings that teach us about human beings in their imperfections, and struggles to betterment .
The point I am making holds ground only if one considers the term ""real world"" in the sense, school of life, practical intelligence necessary to understand the complexity of human beings and adapt oneself in the world. Contrary to what might be thought, to my mind, this knowledge cannot be extracted from books. It is an experimental and personal learning. For example, others' mistakes rarely serve as warnings. In literature, as well hundreds of lives, problems, issues unfold before the reader's very eyes without having him take benefit of this precious experience .
I probably only touched upon the problem, and there remains a great deal more to say on this subject, but unfortunately the lenght restriction allowed me only to scrutinize the tip of the iceberg .
To return to the preliminary remark that a general feeling of emptiness prompted some students to doubt about the value of their university degrees; I am not alone in thinking that our modern society experiences a turning point. The advancing progress of technology and science in every field is not accompanied by a similar move in the field of ethics. The philosophical and ethical emptiness lies in this growing delay. In that case, doubts arise as to what extent universty still fulfills a role that society fails to provide .
As a conclusion, I am of the opinion that this respectable house of knowledge teaches us to learn rather than to comprehend the obscure mechanisms of human soul. I feel that the gist of knowledge manifests itself in our ability to expatiate it in the real world. This can be visualised as a delicious fruit that is not eatable unless one knows how to make it ripen. Therefore, in absolute terms, theoretical knowledge taught at university is not of no value. The responsability rests on the desire each of us invests in combining books' knowledge with his life's experience. And as Rabelais said each one is free to ""extract the substantial marrow"" or to ignore it .",To return to the preliminary remark that a general feeling of emptiness prompted some students to doubt about the value of their university degrees; I am not alone in thinking that our modern society experiences a turning point.,C2

However, there have been posed many questions about whether this rapid technological and scientific improvement is responsible for the social alienation and dehumanization of the individual, about whether people have barricaded on themselves, have become less humane, materialistic and have made money their top priority .

	The decoding of the human DNA is a crucial medical success, since scientists will be able, through experiments and researches, to find cure to diseases that are considered by now as fatal. Human cloning, if it is ever applied, will prove to be of utmost importance for those people who may need an organ transplant .
	In addition, in terms of the technological field, we have the invasion of computers and television as ways of entertainment and relaxing. As far as computers are concerned, not only are they useful in our professional life, but they also offer us, and especially the youth, opportunities to make new acquaintances with people from all over the world, through the use of Internet. So, it could be said that, in this view, computers have put aside the old tradition of having a penfriend. Nowadays, young people can communicate with people from other countries by entering a chat-room or by sending e-mails that are read and answered by the receivers directly, with absolutely no waste of time, in contrast to the old way of corresponding .
	Television is a means of entertainment and relaxation after a very tiresome day. It can live up to everybody's interests, since it includes a variety of channels and programs, starting from childhood up to the elderly people .
	However, on the other hand, there is a great deal of drawbacks because of the excessive industrialization and need to become even more successful . 
First and foremost, the human being has become very vain and gready. He chases money, power and fame as a result he has lost his sensitive and humane feelings. Vanity has made him very selfish and materialistic without understanding that there may come one day when he will lose everything and he may have to begin again from scratch. Trying to catch up with this new way of life and to live up to the society's expectations, man has lost his critical thinking. He doesn't care anymore for social contact, for real communication with other people, because he thinks of everyone around him as a rival. Stress conquers him. In his effort to survive in the hustle and the bustle of the society, he forgets who he really is, where he started from, his dreams, his real goals in life. Nowadays, his goal is to create a successful career and not to become a good person. In the society of today, there is no place for imagination and dreams. The number one priority is money, career .
	Consequently, the human being barricades on himself, is alienated from the outer world. During his entire life, he struggles to create a highly-esteemed personality, a highly-acknowledged career and, in the end, he realizes that he has lost the real essence of life .
	All in all, taking into consideration both pros and cons of the issue, I firmly believe that technological and scientific innovations have improved the quality of our daily life, but this has been done at the expense of our personal life and of our communication with our human beings if this plight deteriorates, then I don?t want to consider its consequences on the human nature .","First and foremost, the human being has become very vain and gready.",C2

I know what I am talking about. I had been doing English for eight years at school and for three more years at university when I decided to spend a couple of weeks travelling round Britain and Ireland, spending a sort of educational holiday there to brush up my geographic and cultural knowledge of it. I started the tour in a small, yet picturesque and lively little seaside resort right at the coast of Northern Ireland. It was the first evening of my holidays and I was keen on getting to know people, talking to native speakers. I was out for the authentic kind of information these people were supposed to be able to deliver as recommended over and over again by teachers and lecturers at home .
In eager anticipation I went to the local pub. As I had hoped I met people very quickly. They were very friendly. At least I could tell that from their behaviour. I could not tell it from what they were saying though, because I did not understand a word. The first man I talked to was the pub owner behind the bar.

095_DBAN3037.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Our society is said to be severely influenced by technology. Nowadays this influence is becoming so big that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is mainly due to the fact that new technologies, such as virtual reality and interactive television, are being developped irresponsibly. With all this new technology, man does no longer have to think for himself, everything is done for him. You could say that these developments are all very good for mankind, but the problem is that man does no longer think, period .
In the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, people had to work so hard, just to keep themselves and their families alive, that there was no time left for dreaming or imagination. But then came technology, because of machines the work became much lighter, people could go on holiday once in a while and had plenty of time to fantasize and dream. In this respect technology has been a blessing for mankind. However this ' blessing ' has now taken on such proportions that for some people it becomes almost impossible to think and dream freely. Technology can be used to stimulate people, to make them form their own opinions, but all too often it is used to impose the opinions and convictions of the people who are in control, on people who are using the technology. From this viewpoint our world is beginning to resemble the worl that Orwell described in ""1984"", a society that is controlled by a few people who have all the means to manipulate other people in such a way that creativity and fantasy become impossible. If however our technology and media are used in a responsible, ""well thoughout"" manner, they will stimulate people to think, give them time to do something else than make money, so that free imagination and dreaming become possible .
There is a second danger connected with this technology. Nowadays it is becoming so strong that you can create your own personal reality with it (the so-called ' virtual reality ' technology). This means that people can create their private universe, in which they control everything, with a computer. This ' virtual reality ' gives so much power to fantasy and imagination that it can become very confusing. The user of this technology could take this fictive world for the real world and suffer a severe shock when he's brought back into the reality, and even worse, he could decide to live the most important part of his life in this ' fictive ' reality and live the life of a vegetable in our reality .
In short one could say that technology has certainly been a blessing for mankind. There should, however, be some control on it, too often man is abused by technology. It's high time to do something about the morbid growth of technology and to try and seek for a system that protects society and its members .",It's high time to do something about the morbid growth of technology and to try and seek for a system that protects society and its members .,C2
088_DBAN2033.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"How sad but true this is! Money and power, science technology and economy, industrialisation and education are the things that really matter in our society. Nowadays dreaming and imagination are becoming more and more second-rate. Our priorities seem to have gone through some changes .
Power, money, technology... are the criteria for 'success' in life and for just being heard and respected. Without success you are nothing in this society. what is striking is, that we seem to have forgotten what it means to be truly happy. We confuse success with happiness. No doubt happiness cannot possibly be obtained without dreams and imagination, without feelings and emotions. Nowadays everything is insensitive, cold, unfeeling..., which is a big problem in our society. There is this fight for survival, everybody on its own in the big bad world. Feelings are inconvenient, superfluous in all aspects of life. They are considered to be the ' things' that hold you back. This is especially the case in business, which is no doubt a dominant factor in our society . ' Business is business' has become a common notion. There is no place for compation, charity, the same way that there is no place for dreaming and imagination. It all boils down to making a profit, productivity, accomplishment .
There is also a lack of time for dreaming, imagination and plain creativity. Our days are carefully planned and more than filled (the rush of daily life). Sure, we still dream but almost only at night, unconscious of it. by the time we have woken up we have forgotten all about it. It does not interest us anymore, we have other things on our minds like work, school, appointments...money, money, money. People get caught in this mill of things and do not see any way out .
Imagination and dreaming are a form of freedom where natural boundaries are exceeded. In our imagination we bare our souls, either conscious or not, with its desires, fears and creative possibilities. Imaginaiton is an introspective tool. We are in a world then where our minds take a broad sweep, where it is not relevant whether or not something is realised, or if problems are solved or created. Imagination is also not something we can force upon ourselves. But it is a necessity for humans to be whole. It is one of the things that distinguishes us from other living creatures .
The negligence of the importance of dreaming and imagination is prevalent at all ages. Even toys nowadays do not leave much to imagination. The more complicated, artificial (supplied with technical devices) the better. Children do not really play anymore. They are no longer creative. They are handed these ' revolutionary ' toys or just put in front of the television in order to keep them busy. This is very passive without the development of the personality or the mind .
People in general spend a considerable amount of time watching TV, which is at the expense of other leisure activities. It has also been proven that TV steals time which would otherwise have been spend on imagination. TV is an ' easy ' medium which requires little mental effort. This leads to a passive ' let you entertain me'-attitude which undermines the willingness to think something up ourselves. TV also undermines the ability to focus your attention on something for quite a long time, which is needed for imagination. TV leads to over-excitement, impulsive thinking, a reduction of attention and restless behaviour. This is also determined by the kind of programmes we watch . ' Kind ' programmes leave our imagination undisturbed. Programmes with much violence and action, however, are adverse on our imagination .
It is really a shame, that we seem to choose for a life without imagination or dreaming. Is happiness not to be found in our minds and hearts rather than in material things, our bank account...? Chateaubriand once said that true happiness is to be found in little things, that if it costs much it is not of the right kind. Our priorities and values in life have changed. We need scientific arguments, proof before we believe in something. We are all very much involved in trying to make something of our lives without really living, experiencing it. We do not seem to care about dreaming and imagination because we believe that it does not provide us with something. Or is this my ' imagination'?",This is also determined by the kind of programmes we watch . ' Kind ' programmes leave our imagination undisturbed.,C2
384_POSI2032.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"Is English an easy language? I would say yes. That opinion is also shared by my fellow-students from the English Department who brush up their English and are certainly proud of its acquaintance. The same question asked in a classroom of teenagers in a primary school will not trigger such as an unanimous response. Well, first of all, any foreign language taught institutionally has to be learned, tested and graded. Naturally, those musts will deter some of the ' less-gifted ' language learners from even hearing English. Attitude and character seem to be here one of the key concepts. Therefore psychologists maintain that extroverts are more apt to acquire second language, while introverts are not expected to make an astounding progress due to their timid disposition and the ascribed lack of communicativeness .
Supposedly, a mediocre but conscientious person whose attitude towards English is fairly favourable intents to learn that language. What facts will he have to face? English may seem difficult to grasp due to its, as it may appear, boundless vocabulary of 500.000 words and 300.000 technical terms. However, a student of FC level needs 5.000 words to be communicatively efficient. The pronunciation might be one of the problems our tongue will have to wrestle with. English [(] and [(] do not have their counterparts in Polish, so only more gifted learners would be able to utter those sounds in the way that will neither resemble [d] or [ t] in the case of the latter and [f] corresponding to the former. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet and 45 sounds. That fact discourages Polish native speakers who use 32 letters and produce 37 sounds. That disproportion of sounds and letters in both languages at least partly explains the apparent discrepancy between the English spelling and pronunciation .
While pronunciation and large English lexicon constitute disadvantages, simplicity of form may easily outweigh them - Polish, Spanish, German or Greek operate on the basis of inflections which indicate singular or plural, person and tense. One of the examples supporting that statement would be the conjugation of the English verb in Simple Present Tense. Adding - s or - es endings in the third person singular seems to be an easy task in comparison with the same procedure in Russian or German. There are seven cases in the declination of the Polish noun and the chore becomes even more complicated if adjectives precede the noun. In English, adjectives do not change according to the noun .
Another characteristic for the benefit of English is its flexibility. The same word can operate as different parts of speech. One of many examples is the word paper. We can drink from paper cups, read a paper and paper a living-room .
The free acceptance of foreign words made English, or more so its American variation an international language. Coupon, kindergarten, graffito, desperado would be instantly understood by the French, Germans, Italians and the Spanish respectively. Although the pronunciation or the spelling of some borrowings may change, they will be easily recognised and used .
English is the most widespread language with 400 million speakers. It is also recognised as the second official language in 60 countries. Do the given facts support the statement that English is an easy language to learn? In some extent yes, but we must admit that literature written in English and mass media build up its strength all over the world. Owing to the latter, we actually acquire English and its omnipresence facilitates learning. American films and songs performed mostly in English have worked their way into the cultures of both post-communist and EEC countries. English is easy to learn in the free-market economy environment. Unlimited access to the variety of English textbooks, magazines, correspondence or interactive courses should please even those choosy or ' less-gifted ' learners .",Do the given facts support the statement that English is an easy language to learn?,C2
145_FRUL2001.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"What strikes me about Marx's original sentence is its provocative aspect. To compare religion and its medium, the church, to a drug is a clear statement. Opium at that time was mainly used as a tranquillizer for sick people in hospitals and was still a legal drug. It is true that some people became opium addicted, in most cases as a consequence of the unknown effects that opium can have on a man's body, if the doses are not controlled by a specialized doctor. Marx saw that religion was used in the same way as the drug. It was meant to satisfy all the people's needs and as an answer to all questions. As a philosopher, Marx clearly recognized the manipulation done by the church, their priests and their interpretation of the Bible. Therefore he claimed the liberation and emancipation from religion .
But nowadays the situation has changed. Most churches, especially the traditional ones, share the same problem which is that of becoming more and more unpopular. Religion and faith do not have the same importance they had a century ago. Already the Roman [Illegible word/phrase] knew the basic needs of the masses: ""panem et circenses"". But the question of bread is not one of life or death nowadays, and most people only turn to religion on such occasions as a funeral or christmas Day, another institution became to play the centre part in every's life and that is television .
This phenomenon became clearly visible in the last two decades and has not reached its climax yet. The main reason for this is that TV satisfies the basic desire to be entertained. So it is not surprising to find at least one TV set in every household. It is the number one mass media. TV not only transmits news and information, game shows and the latest sport results, but also commercials, and this turns out to be its only purpose. The effects of television on our culture have already been described by such authors as Neil Postman, who shows the influence that commercials have. Since TV producers depend on the money paid by the advertisers not only the structure of the TV programme has changed but also our capability of telling reality from fiction. It is well known that films and even the news are splitted into fragments to allow the industries to praise their products, but rather unknown what effect this has on the quality of the programme. The lower its level of comprehension, the better, as if its aim was to be bad that the break for the commercials might function as the climax of the programme. It seems that even the seriousness of the news can not be rescued. We all have learned not to believe everything we read in a newspaper but on the other hand we trust everything that passes as news on TV; who would mistrust his own eyes? The average viewer does not ask himself, how the camera team always manages to be at the right place, at the right time. In our consumption-oriented society only one thing counts: how to realise an increase in sales and to get more consumers? Higher viewing figures guarantee more money. And we play the game and turn the TV on every day because we get what we want, and that is entertainment. We don't recognize that television does not satisfy our needs but only supplies superficialities and so we swallow it all .
What the drugs in our streets and the television have in common is their orientation towards consumption only. Marx would have been among the first to point this out, perhaps in a sentence similar to that in the title, but than he would have also replaced opium with crack .","The lower its level of comprehension, the better, as if its aim was to be bad that the break for the commercials might function as the climax of the programme.",C2

All men cannot be equal. Each one of us is born with different capacity of mind and heart, at different places, under different conditions. Some have more wits or are more open-hearted than others, some have loving parents and a happy childhood, others do not. Some were born with a certain position in society which have secured them better opportunities for education, professional realization, personal or social success, for achieving their goals. Some were handicapped by the conditions of life under which they were born from their first breath of air to the last beat of their heart, entangled in a cruel reality, fighting for every piece of bread in order to keep living just to be able to go on fighting .
Some like their inherited position of life, others do not. Some conform it, others rebel. Some fight for equality, others for a higher status to be more equal than the others .
All men cannot be equal. Not each of us want to have the same conditions of life, opportunities or privileges as the others, some want better ones. Some want to be rich.

Moreover, being influential and having power is not easy as it seems .
All men cannot be equal. That is just an utopia. A beautiful dream cherished in the hearts of generations of men throughout the centuries. Our life is based on inequality.

371_POPZ1009.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"I do not agree with this statement. I think that the prison system is the best way to punish criminals provided that every sentence is actually executed without any exceptions. In the cases of the worst atrocities there should be the capital punishment introduced and executed without changing it into imprisonment under any circumstances .
As long as human race exists there has always existed crime. People established certain laws to curb crime and for many years depriving an individual of his or her freedom or just taking away his or her life has been the only way of protecting society from cruelty, of misfits. Punishment inflicted on those who broke the law does not seem to be a sufficient deterrent only when it is not executed entirely for some reason or other. That is also why there is still a growing number of cases of so called serial killers. Those are the people who kill repeatedly, particularly after being released from prison too early .
Another aspect of the subject is choosing the right punishment for the most serious crimes. There are cases in which the capital punishment is indispensable. Let's look at the example of Dennis Nilsen, a British mass murderer who killed twelve people and dismembered the bodies of his victims. Some time ago he appeared on TV to give an interview in which he presented explicit details of his atrocities. His words delivered in a matter-of fact tone could almost serve as a beginners guide for potential killers on ""how to murder and dispose of your victims"". When the interview was broadcast, it gave Nilsen four minutes of fame and granted him a celebrity status and glamour. It is not difficult to imagine, however, how much distress this programme brought to the relatives of Nilsen's victims, and what is more, it could have encouraged others to follow him. Such a warped man as Nilsen should have been excluded from society long ago, not only by imprisonment, but by the capital punishment .
Rehabilitating people who committed grisly crimes should not take place in a civilised society. This may lead to the anaesthetization to the human cruelty and the whole society may become inured to violence. Dubious remorse shown by criminals is going to evolve into new atrocities very quickly. The individuals who commit crimes are usually weak, ineffectual people and they can assert some power only by killing or by other kind of breaking the law. Very often they themselves admit that they are not able to lead normal life and in exceptional cases, like in case of Westley Dodd, they publicly plead to be executed for their crimes .
There are many arguments for the prison system and against rehabilitation of criminals. Obviously, such a severe punishment is right for them, and what is more, it scares others. Anybody who wants to commit a crime must know for sure that when it comes out, there is no other way but prison. Such system eliminates from the society individuals that may have a very destructive influence on others. Besides, the money that would be spent on rehabilitation of criminals should be allocated to the prevention of crimes instead. What is also very important, the society must know for sure that there is justice in their country and that all the criminals are going to be punished properly. Nobody would like to see acts of revenge done by victims' families in a civilised society .

174_GRAR2032.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"It is true that most university degrees are theoretical and do not provide any kind of practice, but I certainly do not believe that they do not prepare students for the real world and that they are of very little value. However, I believe that not all university degrees are theoretical, there are some university degrees that prepare students adequately for their professional life .
	To begin with, I do believe that most university degrees are theoretical, but that does not necessarily mean that they are useless. In order for someone to become a good professional, that is to be able to do his job correctly, he should have the theoretical background that is needed. In other words, he should have a deep knowledge of all the theories and research that have been developed or carried out in his field of study and then, after he has acquired all this knowledge he will be able to apply them in the future at his job. For example, a teacher does not only have to have knowledge of the subject he is teaching but also he should be aware of all the methodologies and approaches to language teaching and learning so that, when the time comes, he should be able to judge which methodology is the appropriate one for his students and how he should adapt it to fit the needs and wants of the students. All this knowledge of the different kinds of methodologies and research about ways of teaching and ways of learning can be found only in books that are used by theoretical courses in universities and this kind of knowledge is not something that someone can learn by practice .
	The fact that theoretical knowledge is necessary, it certainly does does not mean that practice is not important and that universities should not provide practice to their students so that they can be better prepared for the real world and for what problems they will have to face in the future, when they will working. I truly believe that practice of the students should something obligatory for all students in all universities no matter what the field of study of the student is. It is vital that students have the opportunity to apply all the theoretical knowledge they have acquired during their university studies. The knowledge the students have acquired is meant to be used by them in their everyday working situation in the future and not to stay in their mind forever. For that reason, it is very important that universities give to their students the chance to apply the knowledge they have and the universities should also show them how they can achieve put into practice what they know from their theoretical courses. For example, a graduate of the English Department may be aware of all the methodologies and of all the theories, in general, about language teaching and learning but he may not know how to use all this knowledge in an effective way. This means that students, whatever their field of study, needs guidance by his teachers that are more experienced. Another reason why universities should offer this opportunity to their students is that students need experience. When someone graduates and he is looking for a job, all the employers are looking for someone who has experience that a person who has just completed his studies and has not had any practice during his university studies, he cannot find and thus he cannot find easily a job .
	To sum up, it is vital that students have both theoretical and practical courses. They should have theoretical courses that will provide them all the knowledge that they need and practical course that will help them apply the knowledge that they have acquired in their theoretical courses .","However, I believe that not all university degrees are theoretical, there are some university degrees that prepare students adequately for their professional life .",C2

Secondly, the absence of sheer will force in each and every individual within the period of education. With these contextual and intrapersonal factors, the graduates can rarely relate university learning to real life problems therefore I think the university degrees are becoming more theoretical nationally .

The method Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject just like real life through the experience of problem solving. Students learn both thinking strategies and domain knowledge. The goals of PBL are to help the students develop flexible knowledge, effective problem solving skills, self-directed learning, effective collaboration skills and intrinsic motivation that are critically important in encountering real life situations. The tutor builds students' confidence to take on the problem, and encourages the students, while also stretching their understanding. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy, which is more often lecture-based, theoretically passed, contains way more theoretical units than practical ones and it is used in the whole nation as the primary method of teaching. PBL educates students in a way that they would behave efficiently not only in a domain specific task but also in real life problem solving ones. Our system of education lacks such a perfectly designed method of teaching and learning. So the students cannot benefit from real life stimulations and as a result the problem of relating university learning to real life situations arises.


	Preparation for real life starts since birth. From childhood the humans interacts with the real world through trial and error, reasoning and prior experience of others. Consequently each human being perceives the surrounding world differently from one another; some choose to gain experience from a mistake and look at it positively, meanwhile others try to ignore the whole happening and bury it deep down among other unpleasant errors of human kind. Like all the changes in human condition success comes from will; with the brute force of perseverance the individual can outwit the real life challenge eventually. Since this four legged creature is capable of thinking and making decisions from childhood, in the end the choice is up to the person whether to develop a will toward succession or to be doomed to failure. Observational studies have shown that people think life is becoming harder to get by each year. The reasons and motives for such negative attitude could be economical, regional, psychological, physiological, political, cultural and personal. Thus not having the required volition causes increased rates of difficulty in encountering real life situations . 


The failure in preparation of students for real life can be caused by two reasons. First, problem of do not having the right implemented approach to learning, teaching and assessment that could best serve the growing number of applicants in different fields of study in order to relate theory to practice in real life. Second, we have the power of will; you and I know that it would have the strength to melt mountains to the surface if it is used in a way to see problems solvable and goals reachable. Accordingly the reasons for such depravation may arise from the surrounding of a person or from within him/herself.","To begin with, the lack of the right method of learning within universities.",C2
316_MDCM2041.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"One of the most frequently quoted and paraphrased statements of German philosopher Karl Marx is ""religion... is the opium of the masses."" [Reference] The quotation is taken from the introduction of his posthumously published work ""A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right"". The introduction written in 1843 was published in 1844 in Marx's own journal ""Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher"". People are inclined to be somewhat religious and spiritual. Religion offers an easy escape from reality, it presents as the one good thing that makes life worth living and it definitely helps to take the pain away from the struggles of life. In this essay we will look at the thing that make television the opium of the masses in the 20th and even the 21st century .
	Marx understood that religion served a purpose in society, but that purpose didn't hold to be true. Religion teaches moral, values and beliefs that a society will damage. At the time, opium was seen as a painkiller, so one interpretation of his quote is that people turn to religion to ease the pain of their everyday struggles. The basis of Marx's argument is that humans ought to be led by reason and that religion masks the truth and misguides believers. He believed that when society and life are viewed through the prism of religion, they are so blinded that they cannot see the realities of life. He considered religion to be a false hope and comfort to the poor. He realized that the poor used religion as something that brings comfort in their situation, thus prolonging the process of alienation . [Quotation] [Reference] 
	Nowadays, most people spend more time watching television than going to Church or praying. Some people make heroes out of people on TV. TV obviously shows people what they want, but at the same time it teaches them nothing. It provides a perfect escape from the real world, just as religion did before. More and more people talk about soap operas, quiz shows and advertisements. Advertisements make people materialistic and at the same time unhappy about themselves and the things they have. The fact that people take TV as reality is worrying and it might be said that TV is the blind fold of the 20th and 21st century . 
On the other hand, not all TV is bad. Television is just a medium like the radio and the internet. Every one of us enjoys a certain TV show, but we need to be very careful about the thing we expose ourselves to. Many shows present violent, inappropriate, materialistic programs and sometimes children are the main target of these programs. It is obvious that TV is the easiest way for relaxation and entertainment. Moreover, it is the biggest and the quickest source of information. There is nothing wrong with enjoying TV shows or allowing children to watch some TV, but you have to keep in mind that all of us are exposed to a certain propaganda. In his paper Perry Marshal, advertisement expert, wrote the following: [Quotation] [Reference] . 
	In conclusion, opiates are a form of escape for many people, much in the sense that religion and even television are. Religion offers hope to people who are in need of such assistance. Faith is something that will ultimately improve their views of a number of issues and that is why it is considered to be an opium of the masses. Television also offers some sort of consolation. People sometimes need an escape from society, but it is very important not to get stuck at some unrealistic, utopian place that only exists on the screen .","He believed that when society and life are viewed through the prism of religion, they are so blinded that they cannot see the realities of life.",C2
325_MDCM3065.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"If one characterizes this century as relying only on reason it is easy to extract imagination and the dreams from the centre and instead leave room for a different era that is the era of science, technology and industrialization which many people believe has deprived young people of any imagination and dreams. One is to believe that success is achieved through measuring the achievement in all the above spheres. However, it does not have to be so if one takes into consideration how these three spheres are interpersonally connected to imagination and dreams. This essay will further scrutinize how each three: science, technology and industrialization, are somewhere connected with imagination and dreams .
	If we take Imagination and science one can clearly see that they are seemingly unrelated. Imagination is taken as being the mere expression of a free thought whilst science is unyielding and rigorous. Science is bounded to fall within the understandable and reachable, in contrary imagination is without any boundaries. Both may seem completely different but what most people cannot see is that they are somewhat connected. One similarity that comes to mind is the balance between the two forces that are struggling tenaciously to achieve something of thought. There is a type of mutual relationship between these two opposites. Namely, science needs imagination to thrive, whilst imagination needs some sort of scientific support to function. If one takes scientists as being people strictly following rules and laws we must also engage with the thought that they also need imagination in the creative process. Also, imagists need to rely on science, if not they will fall in utter chaos. Consequently, imagination seems to be present even with parallel existence of science .
	The question we should be asking here is ""what is technology without the imagination part?"" What I am trying to imply here is that, technology is not just the invention of GPS, gadgets and telephones; it is the process that allows our imagination to transpire into the real world. An author enthusiastic about this theme holds that [Quotation] . To prove that, let me take you to Dick Tracy's cartoons where the wrist watch was also a walkie-talkie which has now become reality incorporated in our smart phones. It is a perfect example of imagination brought to the fore and creating something that we nowadays call a technology process. Take this citation for example [Quotation] . So to conclude, imagination is not lost here either, it is just how we perceive things .
	Industrialization can also be seen as interchangeable with imagination. If we take Slater's spinning machine which he produced from memory, the evidence is clear how imagination played a big role in this industrialization part. Another example are the railroads thanks to which transport of goods and people went swiftly and quickly. Let us take into consideration the imagination of an author such as Charles Dickens and his novel Hard Times. He put the question of industrial society as a subject to what might be entitled as the mobilization of imagination. Thus, proving once again how imagination can be put into practice to elaborate on the theme of industrialization .
	To conclude, science, technology and industrialization have all something in common. Namely, they all emerge from one single force that is our imagination. Maria Montessori stated that [Quotation] . In other words, imagination is the starting point which leads to scientific, technological and industrial breakthrough. Every dream is put into notion through imagination which final product depends on where that force is put into practice. Taking the three evolutionary components into consideration, we can clearly see that all are product of our imagination thus, imagination is not lost even long after the appearance of industry, science and technology .",Both may seem completely different but what most people cannot see is that they are somewhat connected.,C2
132_FRUB2005.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"All over the world, money is used for measuring value, for storing wealth and for buying or selling goods. This explains why money is so important and so necessary in our modern society .
Unfortunately money also corrupts society and its members, for people view it as an aim rather than as a means. And the words of the old saying ""money is the root of all evil"" may turn out to be true .
Our modern society is regulated by a capitalist economy. In such a society people's duty is to increase their wealth. Everyone tries to protect his own interest, and at the same time neglects the interests of others. Moreover money is linked with the notion of power, rich people often occupy important positions in society. The poorest people moan about the successes and rewards of others. They make envious remarks and become jealous. So money provokes covetousness, bitterness and resentment. It may even cause hatred and violence. This makes it obvious that greed is one of the most important problem, which we have to deal with in our society. The strong desire for money can indeed destroy happy families, it is quite common to see children quarrelling over money after their parent's death. Money can provoke war between countries. Everyone should remember Sadam Hussein's attack on Kuweit. Sadam's invasion can hardly be justified, when it is explained that Kuweit is one of the richest countries in the world. He saw in this country the perfect means to increase his wealth and power. Sadam's plan shows that some people resort to illegal and dishonest means to gain money. They steal from others what they dream of, or swindle their contemporaries without any remorse. What is quite alarming is that most people forget that money is a means, not an aim. Consequently they reject real human values, which are : honesty, love of one's neighbour, respect, solidarity and charity toward others. Even the most honest people can be tempted to satisfy their craving for money. However money in itself is not bad. It simply depends on what people do with it. It can not be denied that money is one of the basis of our modern society, it enables people to live in a decent and comfortable way, by supplying all their needs. Without money it would be impossible to buy the most essential goods .
Of course the richer people are, the easier it becomes for them to acquire these goods .
Money gives other satisfactions as well. How would it be possible without any money to help people who are in trouble? How could society fight against poverty, starvation, sickness and all the other social ills? Money also contributes to the development in science, art and technology. And finally it appears as a means of collective utility by assuring people's well-being through the creation of a good administration, through the maintenance of an army and the development of cultural structures. So money is an important factor contributing to the progress and stability of our society .
To conclude money is useful, as long as it helps people to respect true human values and to put them into practice. But if it used for another purpose, it has to be condemned and rejected - like any evil force .","Unfortunately money also corrupts society and its members, for people view it as an aim rather than as a means.",C2
380_POSI1007.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"The advocates and opponents of death penalty have been arguing for a very long time. Although there are still fervent followers on both sides of the argument, in the contemporary world one of these sides seems to be gaining advantage over the other .
Countries which are often - and justly, I think - referred to as the most advanced, the most civilized ones, have moved radically away from death penalty. All over Europe this kind of punishment is considered both inhuman and inefficient, and was cancelled more or less recently. As for the United States, it is still valid in some states but is rarely implemented and - even in such a crime-ridden and violent society as America seems to be - often harshly criticized .
The conclusion we are fully entitled to draw from this tendency is that it is what has been constituting our European culture that induces us to abandon death penalty the idea of which clashes sharply with our humanist tradition. This tradition, after centuries of controversy, seems now at last firmly established in our societies, calling upon us to scrap this kind of punishing people for good .
The argument stated above puts death penalty and the need for eradicating it from our lives into a larger, more general perspective. It is fully vindicated in itself but there are also some more substantial grounds that may further reinforce the point we make .
First, those who favour capital punishment believe that it exercises a deterrent effect upon would-be offenders. However, if we look at the statistic data we will see that those deeming so cannot find there any confirmation of their views. Surveys carried all over the world show clearly that the threat of punishment by death neither lessens the number of crimes nor makes those committed any less brutal .
Secondly, we must keep in mind that having sentenced somebody to death and having administered the sentence we cannot rescind it; it is absolutely irrevocable. And what if all of a sudden it turns out that the judges who passed such a verdict were wrong? That there occurred a mistake in the evidence or in the procedure? What if some factor which was hidden or simply overlooked crops up and alters the entire situation? This may always happen. Yet if it does, nothing can be done just because the person who was regarded as guilty and who now appears to be innocent is already punished; in other words - dead. In such circumstances all we can do, apart from chasing the real criminal, is to announce to the world that the person who was sentenced and punished was in fact blameless but by doing so we hardly do justice to him or her as we simply cannot bring them back to life. This is obvious. But let us try more to see the obviousness of things also before, not only after, we have decided to act .
Our third point, unlike the two former ones, does not belong to the sphere of the statistically factual and the immediately verifiable. Thus, it is not so easily observable. This does not mean that it is in any degree more negligible or lacking in urgency. It appeals to our sense of what is and what isn't morally proper, and stems from the ability to feel empathy towards other people, no matter who they are. It boils down to the conviction that it is not the same to be murdered unawares in some dark wood or street and to be put to death in prison. A victim of a murderer might have hoped that he or she would be saved miraculously or would manage to escape, and this hope may be cherished almost to the very end. He or she does not know when exactly (if at all) they will be dead. This is a blessing; it saves an enormous amount of distress that comes from expectation and certainty in these matters. But the prisoner sentenced to death is not spared this knowledge and consequently has to bear the anguish resulting from it. He or she knows for sure that (and when) their execution will take place. This must be unendurable. The position of the prisoner waiting on death row is therefore incomparable with that of, say, somebody who is shot down in a hold-up or knifed or strangled in a marital quarrel. The state must consider carefully what it does to its citizens, even if those in question happen to be criminals. Naturally, wrongdoers have to be punished. But punishing them one must avoid all pain and suffering that is unnecessary, superfluous. And the practice of death penalty causes far too much of such suffering .
Considering the above factors we find it deeply absurd that there are countries where death penalty is still legal .","Countries which are often - and justly, I think - referred to as the most advanced, the most civilized ones, have moved radically away from death penalty.",C2
313_MDCM2035.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"It was back in 1844 when Karl Marx wrote his famous and most quoted statement ""religion is the opium of the masses"". Nowadays there is still controversy regarding what he really meant by it. In my opinion, he saw religion as a means of controlling the masses. Were Max alive at the end of 20th century, he would have replaced religion with television. In this essay, I will discuss why television can be seen as the opium of the masses, focusing on three main reasons: coinage and real meaning of ""couch potato"", essentiality of television for maintaining social infrastructure, and promotion of culture of violence and fear.
	To begin with, it was the appearance of television that brought about the coinage of ""couch potato"". Nowadays, the image of a typical TV viewer is that of a couch potato: [Quotation] [Reference] . In most of the cases ""couch potato"" is only associated with the negative influences it has on health: weight gaining, increasing the chances of diabetes and heart diseases, alcohol and drug abuse. Nevertheless, there is more to couch potato than just negative health influence. It affects both life and mind of a person. For instance, it might cause loneliness and a change in well-established habits . [Quotation] [Reference] . Or in other words, one might be regularly skipping family dinner in order not to miss their favorite show, or preferring to stay at home and watch television rather than go out and socialize. What is more, [Quotation] [Reference] . Alarmingly, a ""couch potato"" person may be rightly called a hypnotized person. Studies have shown that while watching television, the mind is affected and alpha waves are produced by the brain, leaving the person in a light trans.
	Secondly, hypnotized population is what governments need in order to maintain the well established social infrastructure. A study conducted by Krugman proved that while watching television only the right hemisphere of the brain is active. With the left brain hemisphere numb, the brain [Quotation] [Reference] . In addition, another study by Thomas Mulholland shows that alpha waves are produced by the brain after only 30 seconds of watching television. Alpha brain waves are [Quotation] [Reference] . Conversely, watching television is neurologically analogous to staring at a blank wall [Reference] . Both studies imply that television brainwashes viewers' brains and acts as a kind of opium, a drug essential for maintain social infrastructure. Brainwashed viewers do not critically judge or question what is presented to them. Governments might broadcast information and as much of it, as they think the citizens should know. As an example here, I would like to mention the current situation in my country. It is a turbulent period in Macedonia and every day people are protesting on the streets. However, on the vast majority of national TV stations the protests are not mentioned, and when they are, they are referred to as ""vandalism"". 
	Last, but not least, television can be used to promote culture of violence and fear. Television as the opium of the masses does not only make people uncritical towards what they see and hear, but also by broadcasting a lot of violence and violent-related news, it makes people afraid. This culture of violence puts the people in constant state of fear: fear of murder and assault, fear of airplane crashes, fear of violence, especially violence amongst children, and fear of cultural domination. For instance, during the time of Ronald Reagan's presidency in America, the government sponsored TV commercials that, [Quotation] [Reference] . What is more, airplanes are often presented as an unsafe mode of transport, even though [Quotation] [Reference] . Another fear that the television has produced is the fear of differences between people. Racial, ethnical, and religious stereotypes, as well as stereotypes based on sexual orientation, and occupational groups are often presented on television . [Quotation] [Reference] .
	To sum up, television can be rightly regarded as the opium of the masses. From the 20th century onwards it had transformed people into ""couch potatoes"" and it has spread a culture of violence and fear among the people. Moreover, by manipulating and presenting selected information it had been used to maintain the social infrastructure. No doubt, if Marx were alive at the 20th century, he would have replaced religion with television in his famous statement.","Nowadays, the image of a typical TV viewer is that of a couch potato: [Quotation] [Reference] .",C2
377_POPZ2031.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"First of all the state is an institution based on the general agreement of the people. Thus, maintaining that it is the state that uses capital punishment, seems to be a tentative euphemism aimed at making our responsibility rather remote. I personally think, that it is the society and not the state, who permits to eradicate criminals. Hence I intend to use people rather than state as a referent in this essay .
Having clarified this we can procede to the discussion of capital punishment. Is it a punishment? If so what is its role? What are the arguments of its protagonists and antagonists? Is it justifiable? These are the basic questions I shall try to answer in this essay .
Punishment is an infliction of pain, suffering, discomfort or death on a person who has infringed the law, rule or custom of the community. In ancient times it was exacted on the basis of the ""eye-for-an-eye"" rule and was designed only to satisfy the thirst for revenge. Today we claim to be a more civilized society and design punishments not to revenge, but to reform. The major aspect of any punishment is to create the possibilities for the offenders to reeducate themselves, and, having served their sentences, to start new lives, and be useful to the community. Capital punishment is devised exclusively to eradicate people who have committed a mistake, however gross it might have been. It is ultimate, it does not give a second chance. In this respect it fails to meet the requirements of a civilized punishment .
Many of the protagonists of death penalty hold that its main role is to deter the violent crime. They claim that the numbers of offenders who carry guns have increased enormously in the countries, which abolished capital punishment. However the antagonists maintain otherwise. Namely, that death penalty is not an effective deterrent. According to them statistics prove that violent punishment does not tend to bring about a decrease in violent crime .
Another issue, fervently discussed by both parties, is the question of morality. Advocates of death penalty believe it immoral that the taxpayers, who may fall prey to murderers and rapists, should pay for their upkeep in prisons. This claim is difficult to refute. Nevertheless killing people, even if they are habitual criminals, can hardly be called moral. Neither jury nor judge should have the power to put an end to a human life. The antagonists of death penalty would probably conclude that it perpetuates the very evil it seeks to remove .
To stop the viscious circle, the opposition of capital punishment postulates a prison reform. They emphasize the fact that the object of modern penal system is not only the protection of society but also the reclamation of the criminal. Reeducation and reclamation of an offender, they believe, is likely to reduce the amount of crime. The only answer their adversaries give, is that hardened murderers are beyond hope of reform. On the expiry of their sentences they return as the source of danger to the society. Thus eradicating them is the same as cutting of a diseased organ. But who is to judge that the disease can't be cured?
This short discussion of the main points linked to the problem of capital punishment leads to the final question. Is death penalty justifiable? Though, as we have seen, it is a complex issue, but an instinctive answer is simple. Death penalty is not justifiable. First and foremost, it does not meet the requirements of a civilized penal code, because it denies the criminal the right to reform. Second, it does not seem to be an efficient deterrent. Statistics are ambiguous in this respect as it is difficult to account for all sociological factors involved. It also raises numerous moral questions and does not solve any. Finally, it does not cure the society from evil, but only removes responsibility for it from all of us, to one, to the offender. Capital punishment is nothing more than a confession on the part of the community of a failure to protect, educate and support its every member .",It also raises numerous moral questions and does not solve any.,C2
415_SEBJ1030.txt,en,icle500,document-level,learner,CC0 1.0 (Public Domain),"In the 21st century, we are facing extreme materialism and it is obvious that most people only care about power and money. Every day, we witness many cases of workers being abused and made to work more than they are paid for. This, as well as other occurrences lead us to the conclusion already given in the title ""All men are equal: but some are more equal than others.""
A good example to illustrate this statement could be politics nowadays. Wealthy countries dominate the poor ones; even though slavery and colonialism are far behind, we still see that oppression is happening in a subtle way. For example, Africa's natural recources are widely exploited by more powerful countries; sometimes even wars emerge whose true cause are those resoruces - but this is only one thing people do in order to gain more money. We hear statements promoting equality of all people every day, but those are only words; in real life, the situation is quite the opposite. Also, the taxes people pay to their countries should be collected for public expenses, but many politicians neglect citizens' welfare and secretly spend the money for their own needs.
Children and teenagers also face different situations proving that not all people are equal. In schools, the only important thing for pupils has become to look good, have expensive clothes, smartphones and even expensive cars in some cases. The worst thing about that is that a great many parents encourage this in a way and spend a lot of money on their children. It is surprising that even some teachers prefer rich pupils to those who are not equally wealthy. Those who can't afford expensive things are rejected and looked upon as people who don't deserve the same treatment like others. They often have to try much harder, and even in that case success is not guaranteed.
More importantly, in a society where capitalism dominates, workers don't have the rights they should have - they are not paid enough, they perform many jobs simultaneously and they often work longer than they should. An employee in a coffee shop often has to serve thy guests, clean and do any other work necessary. This is another way for more powerful people to make fortune by using others' abilities and hard work. The law is also corrupted and it doesn't protect those people who are forced to work in those harsh conditions in order to make a living. Not only do they have to work hard, but they are not treated equally when they try to get a job - we often hear that somebody had paid a specific sum of money or that they are employer's cousins and were employed owing to these facts.
However, in the last few decades there have been considerable changes concerning women and ethnic minorities, for example. In the past centuries, women had barely any rights; they were not allowed to vote during elections and were not paid as highly as men. That is all in the past now and the situation concerning the equality of sexes is getting better. Also, some ethnic groups were discriminated by the society until recently, but now this is changed and these people can claim their rights as well. Also, some political associations such as the United Nations help to promote human rights and assistance between countries.
Many organizations have been founded recently whose goal is to help poor people and there are always new campaigns promoting human rights and equality of all people. Many people are willing to help and they often donate money and other necessary things useful for those who need help, not taking their race or nationality into consideration. For example, the Red Cross is an international organization whose aim is the benefit of old, sick and poor people from around the world.
To sum up, equality is certainly promoted in the society, but it is controversial and also raises questions about how true this is in real life. Even through media, we are faced with numerous prejudices and attitudes that show us that some men truly are more equal than others. Unfortunately, all these prejudices are mostly based on money as an indication of how valuable people are.",Many organizations have been founded recently whose goal is to help poor people and there are always new campaigns promoting human rights and equality of all people.,C2
